<h5 class="lg150">PREFACE.</h5>

  <p>Compared with our butterflies, the number of moths found in the
  British Isles is very large. Like the butterflies, moths too are
  dependent upon plant life, and almost every kind of herb, bush, or tree,
  will be found to nourish the caterpillars of one or more species of
  moth.</p>

  <p>Not only the field botanist, but every rambler in the country must
  constantly come across moths or caterpillars that will probably interest
  him, and of which he would be glad to learn something about their habits,
  life-history, and the position they occupy in the arrangement and
  classification of Natural History objects.</p>

  <p>In the preparation of this little book on our moths, the author has
  proceeded closely on the lines adopted when dealing with the butterflies
  in his previous volume. That is, the chief aim has been to place before
  the nature lovers as much information concerning these creatures as could
  be condensed into moderate limits.</p>

  <p>Lengthy descriptions were out of the question, but what might be
  considered an omission in this way, is amply compensated for by the
  life-like portraits of typical examples of the moths themselves, and in
  many cases of their more important varieties. Technicalities have been
  avoided as far as possible, the main object being to provide a guide to
  the identification of our moths, together with a simple account of the
  whole or a part of their earlier stages.</p>

  <p>The author is fully aware that this method of treatment only enables
  him to touch the fringe of the subject, as it were, but he has been
  content to deal with it in this way, as it appeared to be the kind of
  information that would most nearly meet the requirements of the
  majority.</p>

  <p>The author desires here to express his thanks to Mr. Robert Adkin,
  F.E.S., for the loan of specimens of <i>L. c&oelig;nosa</i>, <i>E.
  ilicifolia</i>, <i>D. harpagula</i>, <i>N. albula</i>, <i>N.

  the use of drawings of the caterpillars of <i>D. tiliæ</i>, <i>S.
  fagi</i>, <i>L. bicoloria</i>, <i>P. ridens</i>, <i>A. auricoma</i>,

<h5 class="lg150">PREFACE TO THE PRESENT EDITION.</h5>

  <p>A new edition of this volume having become necessary, it was deemed a
  fitting opportunity to bring the subject matter somewhat in line with our
  present knowledge of the Nomenclature, Habits, and Distribution of the
  Species considered therein. With this end in view, the new facts have
  been incorporated in the text so far as this was possible. Matter that
  could not be accommodated in this way has been presented in the form of
  an Appendix.</p>

  <p>The changes in the names of genera are not numerous, and in every case
  where such change has been made, the name used in the first edition has
  been placed in brackets&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> <i>Pieris daplidice</i> of the
  1st edition becomes in the present one <i>Pontia (Pieris)
  daplidice</i>.</p>

  <p>By this treatment it has been found convenient to utilise the old
  Index and, at the same time, to provide a Specific Index for those who
  prefer to consult the volume by its aid.</p>

<h5 class="lg200">THE MOTHS OF THE BRITISH ISLES.</h5>

<h5>PART I.</h5>

<h5 class="lg125">INTRODUCTORY.</h5>

  <p>As mentioned in "Butterflies of the British Isles," there is, speaking
  generally, no clear line of division between moths and butterflies, and,
  as Dr. Sharp, in "Insects," puts the case, "the only definition that can
  be given of Heterocera [moths] is the practical one that all Lepidoptera
  that are not butterflies are Heterocera." Now, it happens that all the
  butterflies occurring in these islands have the tips of the horns
  (<i>antennæ</i>) clubbed; and, although there is much variety in the
  structure of the horns of our moths, none of them have the tips
  knobbed.</p>

  <p>Like the butterflies, moths pass through the stages of egg,
  caterpillar, and chrysalis before they attain the perfect state
  (<i>imago</i>), and the duration of the several stages is just as
  variable. The majority assume the moth condition but once in the year,
  but some species have two, or even three, generations in the twelve
  months, whilst others occupy twenty-four months in completing the life
  cycle. In one or two species the chrysalis stage may last four, five, or
  even six years.</p>

  <p>Diversity of form and structure is considerable in the early stages as
  well as in the perfect insects, and this is shown in the <!-- Page 2
  --><span class="pagenum" title="014.png"><a
  name="page2"></a>{2}</span>selection of life-history details figured on
  the black and white plates in this volume.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Except that it is generally less prominent, the head, with the various
  parts thereof, is pretty much the same as in the butterflies. In a few
  families, however, the "tongue" (proboscis) is only rudimentary or even
  entirely absent; while in others it is very long. The Convolvulus
  Hawk-moth has the proboscis of such length that it is able to reach the
  deep-seated nectary of such tubular flowers as those of <i>Nicotiana
  affinis</i>. In the illustration the "tongue" of the moth and the
  sweet-scented tobacco blossom are shown on exactly the same scale.</p>

  <p>Fig. 2 represents some forms of antennæ found in moths. A, <!-- Page 3
  --><span class="pagenum" title="015.png"><a
  name="page3"></a>{3}</span>thickened and spreading out towards the tip
  (<i>dilate</i>); B, simple, thread-like (<i>filiform</i>) structure,
  without teeth, hairs, or bristles; C, fringed with fine hairs
  (<i>ciliate</i>); D, fringed with fine hairs, and with longer bristles at
  the joints (<i>setose ciliate</i>); E, the fringe in tufts
  (<i>fasciculate</i>); F, toothed, with fine hairs on the teeth
  (<i>dentate ciliate</i>); G, toothed with hairs in tufts from the teeth
  (<i>dentate fasciculate</i>); H, I, with double rows of hair scales
  (<i>bipectinate</i>); in I the projections are continued to the tip, and
  are themselves fringed with fine hairs, giving the antennæ a very
  feather-like appearance&mdash;the term "plumose" is sometimes used to
  describe this form of antennæ; in H the pectinations do not reach the
  apical fourth, which is simple. J, the <i>lamellate</i>, that is, the
  undersides of the rings or joints are made up of minute plates.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center"><b>Connecting Bristle and Catch.</b></p>
  </div>

  <p>The wings of a moth are practically identical with those of a
  butterfly (see diagram "Butterflies of the British Isles," p. 12).
  Normally the fore wings have twelve ribs or veins, and the hind <!-- Page
  4 --><span class="pagenum" title="016.png"><a
  name="page4"></a>{4}</span>wings eight, but in some genera a rib, or
  perhaps two, may be absent from the fore or the hind wings; or an extra
  rib, sometimes two, may be found on the hind wings. These modifications,
  and others, of the general plan of neuration have been employed as a
  basis upon which to found genera, or to group them together in
  classification.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:10%;">
      <a href="images/fig04.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig04.jpg"
      alt="Fig. 4." title="Fig. 4." /></a>
    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig. 4.</span></p>

    <p style="text-align:center"><b>The Jugum, or Yoke.</b></p>
  </div>

  <p>Fig. 3 shows the arrangement by which the upper and lower wings of a
  moth are united in flight. The bristle (<i>frenulum</i>) arising from the
  base of the hind wing is held in place by the catch (<i>retinaculum</i>)
  on the costal nervure of the fore wing. It will be noticed that the
  bristle of the male is longer and firmer than that of the female. The
  latter, moreover, is usually made up of two or more strands; the catch,
  too, in the female is on the median instead of the costal nervure. These
  structures are found on the under side of the wings of most moths, but
  they are absent in all butterflies. The Emperor, Kentish Glory, and
  Eggars may be mentioned as examples of moths lacking the connecting
  bristle, but all these have feather-like antennæ, which terminate in a
  point. The Burnets have the antennæ gradually thickened towards the tip
  (A. Fig. 2), and in this respect are somewhat butterfly-like, but these
  moths have a frenulum.</p>

  <p>The hind wings of the Swifts, and a few others grouped with them, have
  twelve veins, and these moths have a <i>jugum</i>, or yoke (see Fig. 4).
  This is a flap-like projection from the inner margin, near the base, of
  the fore wing; it may serve to connect the wings when the insect flies,
  but it does not seem to be capable of giving much help in that way. <!--

    <p style="text-align:center"><b>Pale Tussock-moth at rest.</b></p>
  </div>

  <p>In describing a moth various markings, etc., have to be referred to,
  and as it may assist the reader more easily to locate the usual position
  of such characters the accompanying diagram has been prepared. The lines
  crossing the fore wings from the front edge, or margin (<i>costa</i>), to
  the inner edge, or margin (<i>dorsum</i>), are generally styled
  transverse lines; the short one is the basal; the first long one is the
  inner, or antemedial; the second is the outer, or postmedial; and the
  third is the submarginal, or subterminal. The whole wing, less the
  margins, is sometimes called the disc; but it is more convenient to
  divide the fore wing into three parts, naming that between the base of
  the wing and the first line the basal area; the space between the first
  and second lines the central or median area, and the part beyond the
  second line the outer area. The more or less round or oval rings or
  dashes on <!-- Page 6 --><span class="pagenum" title="018.png"><a
  name="page6"></a>{6}</span>the central area are the stigmata, and these
  characters occur more especially in the Noctuidæ. The hind wings usually
  have a fine short line, crescent, or spot, at the end of the cell, as in
  the butterflies, and there is generally a line or band beyond.</p>

  <p>Immediately behind the head and covering the front part of the thorax
  is a tippet-like arrangement of scales; this is the collar. On each side
  of the thorax there is a shoulder lappet (<i>patagium</i>) which has its
  base on the front part of the thorax also. Both tippet and lappet are
  often peculiarly ornamented, and the former is sometimes strikingly
  coloured. The thorax is sometimes crested, and more frequently the body
  is furnished with tufts of erect hair scales.</p>

  <p>The number of moths occurring in the British Islands is well over two
  thousand. The majority of these hardly ever find favour with the
  collector. This is probably owing in a large measure to the fact that
  they belong to a division of the moth tribe which has been dubbed
  Micro-lepidoptera. It happens, however, that quite a number of the
  species included in that division are actually larger than many kinds
  that were placed in the other contingent styled Macro-lepidoptera.
  According to the most recent authorities the division of moths into two
  such main groups as those adverted to is entirely fictitious and
  misleading. Possibly, when this new order of things is more generally
  understood the so-called "Micros" will receive their proper share of
  attention.</p>

  <p>In the older systems of classification the Clear wings (Sesiidæ) were
  associated with the Hawk-moths (Sphingidæ), but the former family is now
  considered to be more closely connected with the Tineidæ. The Goat-moth
  (<i>Cossus ligniperda</i>) has been removed from among the Bombyces, its
  name changed to <i>Trypanus cossus</i>, and placed in the family
  Trypanidæ, which is relegated to the neighbourhood of the Tortricidæ. The
  Burnets (Zygænidæ), together with <i>Heterogenea limacodes</i> and <i>H.
  asella</i> (Cochliopodidæ), also <i>Macrogaster castaneæ</i> and
  <i>Zeuzera pyrina</i> (Cossidæ <!-- Page 7 --><span class="pagenum" title="019.png"
  ><a name="page7"></a>{7}</span>part) are removed by Meyrick to the
  Psychina, a group placed between that author's Pyralidina and Tortricina.
  The Swifts (Hepialidæ) are grouped with Micropterygidæ, which are
  considered to be primitive forms of Lepidoptera originating in the
  Caddis-flies or Trichoptera&mdash;a division of the Order Neuroptera.</p>

  <p>Except that the Cymbidæ and Arctiidæ are placed just before the
  Noctuidæ instead of after the Geometridæ, the arrangement of families,
  genera, and species adopted in the present work is very much the same as
  that in the 1901 edition of Staudinger's Catalogue. Many British
  entomologists are now interested in the lepidopterous insects of the
  Palæarctic, or at least the European, fauna, of which our islands furnish
  but a relatively small number of species. Others, who at the present time
  are perhaps but beginners, may very possibly desire, later on, to extend
  their collections and their knowledge by making entomological expeditions
  to various parts of the continent. It seemed therefore desirable that in
  an introductory book on British moths its method of arrangement should at
  least be founded on some generally accepted system. <!-- Page 8 --><span

  </div>

  <p>Several methods of moth collecting are in vogue, but space will only
  permit of a few of those most frequently practised being here referred
  to, and those suitable for day work will first be considered. Although
  small woods should not be neglected, large tracts of woodland afford the
  moth hunter the best chance of success in searching for those species
  that usually sit during the daytime on the trunks of trees. Many of the
  moths that rest in this way so admirably blend with their surroundings
  that they may easily be overlooked; others by their resemblance to
  feathers, birds' excrement, etc., are also apt to escape detection. Tree
  trunks, too, abound in moth-like scars, blotches, and knobs, so that the
  beginner will frequently fail to readily distinguish a moth from such
  objects, or from the others mentioned. A little practice will soon enable
  him to tell <!-- Page 9 --><span class="pagenum" title="021.png"><a
  name="page9"></a>{9}</span>which is which without having to very closely
  investigate, or perhaps even touch the suspected object.</p>

  <p>As a general rule it is no doubt best to confine ourselves to one
  thing at a time, if the results are to be satisfactory and the work well
  done. In the present case, if he feels that way, the collector can
  relieve the monotony of trunk searching by operating in another direction
  at the same time. Some moths prefer to repose on the branches, or on the
  leaves of trees, others among the herbage under trees; these may be
  disturbed from their lurking places and caused to fall or take wing by
  jarring the boughs or brushing the undergrowth with a stick.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center"><b>Broad-bordered Yellow Underwing at

  </div>

  <p>Palings, especially old ones and those enclosing wooded parks, etc.,
  are often frequented by numbers of moths. These should be examined as
  early as possible in the morning, although <!-- Page 10 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="022.png"><a name="page10"></a>{10}</span>a later
  looking over may not be unprofitable. When, however, the wind is dead on
  them, or where they stand exposed to full sunshine, few insects will be
  found upon them. Various species are to be obtained from open post and
  rail fences, and even iron hurdles sometimes yield a good moth or two.
  Walls are not to be despised, and of course rocks on the moorlands, and
  the cliffs by the sea afford suitable resting-places for many kinds of
  moth. As a matter of fact the eyes of the entomologist should always be
  peering about, as a valuable prize may turn up in the most unexpected
  places. Hedgerows and bushes in lanes, or bordering fields and woods,
  afford harbour to many species of moths, and some kinds, not necessarily
  the commonest, may now and then be beaten from them freely. Herbage on
  hill or down sides, and on the moor and moorlands is also a favourite
  hiding-place, as too is the marram grass, etc., on the coast
  sandhills.</p>

  <p>As the day draws to a close and the night advances, the moths awaken,
  and first one kind and then another rises on the wing. These, as they fly
  in the lanes, about the borders or along the rides of woods, and over the
  vegetation in meadow, <!-- Page 11 --><span class="pagenum" title="023.png"

  employment and keep the collector actively engaged until the time arrives

    <p style="text-align:center"><b>Moths at a Sugar patch.</b></p>
  </div>

  <p>This sugaring business is perhaps the most exciting phase of
  collecting. Having prepared a fine compound of coarse brown or "foots"
  sugar, treacle, and beer, by boiling down these ingredients to a suitable
  liquid condition, this is taken to the scene of action in a sugaring tin,
  a receptacle fitted with a brush which is fixed in the screw-on top; or
  the attracting medium may be carried in any kind of convenient bottle
  providing a paintbrush (sash tool) and a jampot or some such article
  accompany it. Arrived on the ground, preferably a wood, a ride is
  selected along each side of which are convenient trees. A glade such as
  that in the New Forest, photographed by Mr. W. J. Lucas, and reproduced
  in Fig. 12, is an ideal pitch. Just before using, a very small quantity
  of rum may be added to the mixture, but if "foots" can be obtained the
  rum is not required. In the autumn I have found a drop or two of the
  essence of <!-- Page 12 --><span class="pagenum" title="024.png"><a
  name="page12"></a>{12}</span>jargonelle pear, or of ribstone pippin, an
  effective addition. Now comes the initial stage in the night's venture,
  the "sugar" is put on each tree in a streak extending downwards about a
  foot from the level of one's chin; if thin enough to spread easily the
  mixture is almost certain to run further down the trunk. Whilst employed
  in this somewhat messy preliminary we meditate on the possible result,
  and hope that if visitors are not numerous they may at least be select.
  Lighting the lantern, the first round of inspection of the sugar patches
  is made, but this may not be altogether encouraging; on only one tree are
  there any moths and these but three in number, and not uncommon kinds
  (see Fig. 13). The second and even the third rounds do not <!-- Page 13
  --><span class="pagenum" title="025.png"><a
  name="page13"></a>{13}</span>give the satisfactory results we had
  anticipated, and we feel inclined to retire discomfited; but as a sort of
  forlorn hope we try once again, and this time we secure one or two really
  good things. Another night moths arrive quite early and in large numbers,
  chiefly commoners, but with a sprinkling of the better sorts among them.
  Just what meteorological or other conditions are most conducive to a
  successful sugaring expedition I have never been able to ascertain. Often
  blanks have been drawn when the weather has seemingly been the most
  favourable, and quite as frequently good bags have been made when exactly
  the reverse was thought to be more likely. If the natural attractions
  <!-- Page 14 --><span class="pagenum" title="026.png"><a
  name="page14"></a>{14}</span>in the way of flowers and "honey dew"
  abound, the insects may possibly ignore the most tempting bait we can
  contrive for them. There is much uncertainty in this favourite method of
  collecting, and whether sugar is put on tree trunks, foliage, palings,
  rocks, or stones, or smeared on rags, and these hung up on barbed wire
  fences; or daubed on heads of thistles or bunches of grass heads tied
  together, one must be prepared to accept the disappointments that are
  inevitable, however careful we may be in the selection of "suitable
  evenings." It may be added that newly sugared trees are generally less
  attractive than those that are frequently painted with the mixture.</p>

  <p>Caterpillars that feed on the foliage of trees and shrubs may <!--
  Page 15 --><span class="pagenum" title="027.png"><a

  one hand holds an open and inverted umbrella, or a Bignall tray made
  expressly for the purpose, under a branch, whilst with the other hand,
  armed with a stick, he strikes the branches from above in the direction
  of the receiver held below. In conducting such operations some collectors
  are far too energetic. It should be remembered that it is not hard
  thrashing, but a sudden jar that dislodges the caterpillars most
  readily.</p>

  <p>Although oft-times a somewhat slow process, and to some temperaments,
  perhaps, rather tedious work, searching for larvæ is not unremunerative
  when the quality of the material obtained in this way is considered. Some
  kinds sit in the daytime, or feed, fully exposed, upon the upper sides of
  the leaves or on the twigs of trees, shrubs, and low herbage; these are
  not difficult to see. Other kinds conceal themselves under the leaves or
  on the twigs hidden by the foliage, and these have to be sought for,
  because many of them cling so tightly to whatever they may be upon that
  hardly anything short of a fatal blow with the beating-stick will cause
  them to relax their hold. Others, again, spin two or more leaves
  together, and in the <!-- Page 16 --><span class="pagenum" title="028.png"
  ><a name="page16"></a>{16}</span>habitation thus formed they remain
  throughout the day. The latter are more easy to see than the more readily
  evicted contingent. All we have to do is to stand under the branches and
  look upwards and outwards, when the united leaves and the form of the
  caterpillar between them will be detected. Some, of course, will be high
  up and out of reach in the ordinary way, but there will be others more
  accessible. Then, at night, especially in the early spring, we may
  search, aided by the beam of an acetyline lamp, the plants and
  undergrowth in wood rides and clearings, borders of woods, and lanes, for
  caterpillars that are arousing from hibernation. Throughout all searching
  operations for larvæ the chance finding of eggs under leaves or on twigs
  or buds is always probable. Cocoons in addition, among the leaves of
  trees and on stems of low plants and the trunks of trees, may also be
  revealed.</p>

  <p>Furnished with a trowel&mdash;the ordinary garden kind will do, but
  the flatter pattern, sold by dealers, is better&mdash;the collector may
  take a turn at digging at the roots of trees for chrysalids. No doubt
  there are many kinds to be obtained in this way, but I cannot say much
  for the practice, as my own efforts have not been very highly rewarded.
  Not a single species was ever obtained by digging that I could not have

<h5 class="lg125">PART II.</h5>

<h5 class="lg150">DESCRIPTIONS OF SPECIES.</h5>

<h5 class="lg125">HAWK-MOTHS.</h5>

  <p>About sixty species belonging to this family, scientifically known as
  the Sphingidæ, are recorded from the Palæarctic region, and of these
  twenty-seven are found in Europe. About ten only can be considered as
  true natives of the British Isles; seven others, though found here, are
  distinctly aliens, and their visits, at least as regards some of them, to
  our islands, exceedingly irregular.</p>

  <p>Most of the moths are of large size, many of the caterpillars are of
  noble proportions, and in both stages they are not difficult to find, if
  looked for in suitable places and in their proper season. The
  caterpillars of several kinds, owing to the exposed way in which they
  feed or rest, are especially noticeable on bush and hedgerow; the
  chrysalids, although subterranean, are often freely obtained by turning
  up the soil around trunks of trees, or under plants, upon which the
  caterpillars feed.</p>

<h5><b>The Lime Hawk-moth</b> (<i>Dilina</i> (<i>Mimas</i>) <i>tiliæ</i>).</h5>

  <p>The four specimens shown on Plate <a href="#plate3">3</a> represent
  the more or less ordinary form of this moth. The pale pinkish grey, or
  reddish brown, fore wings are sometimes tinged with greenish in the paler
  forms; the irregular shaped band crossing the <!-- Page 18 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="030.png"><a name="page18"></a>{18}</span>central
  area of the wings is olive green, usually dark, and generally edged with
  whitish. This band is sometimes entire (typical), but more frequently it
  is broken about the middle. The outer third of these wings is more or
  less greenish or mottled with green, and a mark near the tip is
  whitish.</p>

  <p>Variation is chiefly connected with the modifications that occur in
  the upper or lower, sometimes both, portions of the central band; the
  lower seems to be the first to disappear, then the upper passes through
  various stages of reduction until it becomes simply a spot or dot about
  the centre of the wing. Specimens are occasionally found or reared, in
  which every trace of the band has departed from one or both fore wings.
  The greenish outer border of the wings is inwardly margined with darker,
  well defined and band-like in some examples, but less clearly marked, or
  even absent, in others. Near the base of the fore wings are often two
  dusky greenish cross lines. The hind wings, generally pretty much of the
  same ground colour as the fore wings, have a dusky band-like shade of
  variable width on the outer third; sometimes these wings are entirely
  dusky, approaching blackish. Very rarely specimens are bred in which
  there is no trace of green colour. Such an example was reared by Mr.
  Frohawk in April, 1882, from a caterpillar he found in Surrey. In this
  aberration all the markings (normally green) are light burnt-sienna red,
  the usual whitish blotch at the tip of the fore wings is pink; ground
  colour also pink, slightly tinged with grey in places. So variable is
  this moth in colour and markings, that in some collections at least one
  cabinet drawer is given to it so that the range of aberration may be
  adequately shown. Already about eighteen colour modifications have been
  named, and at least eight band variations have also received names.</p>

  <p>The egg is similar in general appearance to that of the next species
  (see Plate <a href="#plate4">4</a>). Dr. Chapman states that it is more
  densely covered with an indiarubber-like gum, and this may cause it to
  seem darker than the eggs of the Eyed and the Poplar Hawk-moths. The eggs
  are laid singly or in pairs on the underside of elm or lime leaves.</p>

  <p>The figure of a nearly full-grown caterpillar (Plate <a
  href="#plate2">2</a>) is from a drawing in colour by Mr. A. Sich.
  Shortly, the caterpillar may be described as green, roughened with yellow
  points, and with seven yellow oblique stripes on the sides, each edged
  above with purplish and reddish; the spiracles are ringed with reddish,
  and the curved horn is blue, inclining to yellowish beneath and at the
  tip; the roughened shield on the last ring of the body is reddish, marked
  with yellow. Head triangular, smoother than the body. Quite in its
  infancy, the caterpillar is a long, thin creature; the horn, which is
  divided at the tip, is covered with short, stiff hairs, and appears
  blackish; later on the horn becomes reddish, and the side stripes appear
  on the body. Although alder, birch, and several other shrubs and trees
  have been mentioned, there is no doubt that the foliage of elm and lime
  is the chief food of the caterpillar in a state of nature. Found in July
  and August.</p>

  <p>The chrysalis is dark reddish, and somewhat rough. As a rule, it is
  enclosed in a very fragile cell which the caterpillar makes for itself
  after burrowing a few inches underground and near the trunk of an elm or
  a lime tree. There are, however, records of the chrysalis having been
  found in crevices of bark high up on elm trees.</p>

  <p>In May and June the moth emerges, usually in the afternoon, and may
  sometimes be found on the trunks of trees, or on palings near limes and
  elms. When at rest the fore wings are so arranged over the hind ones that
  they, in conjunction with the upturned body, give the insect more the
  appearance of a bunch of immature leaves than of a moth.</p>

  <p>The species is widely distributed throughout the southern counties of
  England, and in some of them, more especially around London, it is
  common. In the Midlands it seems to be <!-- Page 20 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="034.png"><a name="page20"></a>{20}</span>scarce,
  and apparently does not occur further north than Yorkshire, from which
  county there is only a single record. It is common in Europe, except in
  the more northern and southern parts, and its range extends eastwards
  into Siberia.</p>

<h5><b>The Poplar Hawk-moth</b> (<i>Smerinthus</i> (<i>Amorpha</i>) <i>populi</i>).</h5>

  <p>On Plate <a href="#plate5">5</a> are three slightly different examples
  of this moth. In colour it is most frequently ashy grey, with a brownish
  central band, and other markings; there is a white spot on the fore wings
  and a conspicuous red patch at the base of the hind wings. The female is
  generally paler than the male, and often has a pinkish tinge. Specimens
  of a pale buff colour are sometimes obtained, and these are most often of
  the female sex, although male examples of this form are not unknown.
  Among unusual aberrations is one described as having the wings, legs,
  thorax, and abdomen of a colour between brick-red and chocolate, suffused
  with a whitish bloom as on ripe plums. Another had the hind wings
  unadorned with red. Specimens from Aberdeenshire and Sutherlandshire are
  smaller than English examples, and the males are almost always more
  brightly and distinctly marked.</p>

  <p>A very large number of Gynandrous, or "hermaphrodite" specimens have
  been recorded, several of them from Britain; in most of these the
  gynandromorphism is bilateral, that is the insect is wholly male on one
  side, and entirely female on the other. In some the right side is male,
  in others the left side; the opposite side in each case being female.
  Much information on this subject and on Hybridism of the Sphingidæ will
  be found in Tutt's "British Lepidoptera," vol. iii.</p>

  <p>The pale shining green eggs are laid, generally singly, but sometimes
  in twos, threes, or more, on either surface of a leaf of poplar or
  sallow. Now and then batches of eggs may be found, and these have
  probably been laid by females that were crippled on emergence, or had
  been afterwards injured in some way and so were unable to fly.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center"><b>Eggs of Poplar Hawk-moth.</b></p>
  </div>

  <p>When full grown the caterpillar is green, roughened with yellow
  points, oblique stripes on the sides yellow, spiracles reddish, horn of
  the general colour, sometimes tipped with reddish. Head triangular in
  shape, but not pointed on the top. A reddish spotted form of the
  caterpillar is not very uncommon. In its very early life the head is
  rather triangular than rounded, as is the head of the young caterpillar
  of the previous species, and also that of the Eyed Hawk. Feeds on poplar,
  aspen, sallow, and willow, and may be found from July to September and
  sometimes October. Chrysalis blackish, rougher than that of the Lime
  Hawk. It lies in the ground so close to the surface that it is often
  exposed when the garden borders under or near poplars are raked over. The
  moth appears in May and June as a rule, but in backward seasons it may
  not emerge until July or even August. Caterpillars from eggs laid in
  early May are likely to feed up and attain the perfect state in late
  July, and eggs resulting from these will pass through the caterpillar
  state to that of chrysalis by about <!-- Page 22 --><span class="pagenum" title="038.png"
  ><a name="page22"></a>{22}</span>September. Three broods have been
  obtained in one year, but this is exceptional and under a forcing method
  of treatment. The early stages are figured on Plate <a
  href="#plate4">4</a>. This is certainly the commonest of our Hawk-moths,
  and it seems to occur throughout our islands, except that in Scotland it
  is not recorded further north than Sutherland and Ross. Wherever there
  are poplars, sallows, or willows, there too most probably will be this
  caterpillar in its season; the moth also will be almost certainly seen by
  any one who may care to keep an eye on the stems of poplars or adjacent
  fences at the right time. Sometimes the insect will introduce itself to
  the household, after lighting-up time, much to the alarm of those who,
  not aware of the harmless character of their visitor, look upon it with
  considerable suspicion.</p>

  <p>Distribution abroad&mdash;Europe (except the polar regions and
  Greece), Armenia and the Altai.</p>

<h5><b>The Eyed Hawk-moth</b> (<i>Smerinthus ocellatus</i>).</h5>

  <p>Except that there is sometimes an absence of rosy tinge on the fore
  wings, and that the brownish markings may be lighter or darker, this
  species does not depart very greatly from the typical form shown on Plate
  <a href="#plate7">7</a>.</p>

  <p>Cross pairings between the Eyed-hawk and the Poplar-hawk are not
  altogether difficult to obtain, but the female <i>populi</i> pairs more
  readily with male <i>ocellatus</i> than the female of the last named
  species will with the male of <i>populi</i>. Very few such cross pairings
  have been noted in a wild state, but several cases of the kind are known
  to have occurred in captivity. The results are hybrid moths, and these
  have some of the characters of each parent, and have received distinctive
  names. Thus the offspring of <i>ocellatus</i> &#x2642; × <i>populi</i>
  &#x2640; are the <i>hybridus</i>, Steph., whilst that of <i>populi</i>
  &#x2642; × <i>ocellatus</i> &#x2640; are referable to <i>inversa</i>,

  <p>The eggs, which are generally laid singly or in pairs on either side
  of a leaf, sometimes on a stalk, are yellowish-green in colour. The shell
  is said to be netted, but under a fairly strong lens this does not show.
  About four hundred is probably the average number for a female to lay in
  a state of nature, but they seem not to deposit so many when reared from
  the egg in confinement. As the moth, except under stress of
  circumstances, places her eggs on the foliage of trees and bushes in
  selected positions, the business of egg laying takes about six nights to
  perform. Even when she is unable to fly she will crawl from twig to twig
  and glue an egg here and there on the leaves, but rarely more than two on
  a leaf. On a small sallow bush in my garden, I once counted eighty-four
  eggs on the lower leaves and the main stem. Green, inclining to yellowish
  or greyish, is the colour of the full-grown caterpillar. It is roughened
  with white points, and has seven whitish oblique stripes on the sides.
  These stripes are edged in front with darkish green and occasionally
  tinged with violet. The horn is bluish, merging into green towards the
  dark tip, and roughened with white points. Head triangular in shape, the
  top pointed; face tinged with bluish. Sometimes bright red spots appear
  on the sides in some examples of the caterpillar. In the quite young
  stage the head is usually rounded; the horn, which appears reddish, is
  about one third the length of the caterpillar.</p>

  <p>Sallow, willow, and apple are the more general food plants, but poplar
  and privet have been reported. I have sometimes found the larva on
  <i>Salix repens</i>, and also on crab-apple (<i>Pyrus malus</i>). It may
  be found in July and August. In some years, when the moths emerge in May,
  caterpillars are found as early as June, and this is followed by the
  occurrence of the caterpillar again, as a second brood, in August and
  September. When quite mature the caterpillar enters an inch or two into
  the soil, and there forms a weak sort of cell in which it shortly
  afterwards turns to a brown, or blackish-brown, smooth and <!-- Page 24
  --><span class="pagenum" title="042.png"><a
  name="page24"></a>{24}</span>rather glossy chrysalis. The early stages
  are figured on Plate <a href="#plate6">6</a>.</p>

  <p>The moth usually emerges in June, earlier or later, according to
  season. Under very favourable circumstances some of the moths will leave
  the chrysalis in May and give rise to a second generation in July. An
  unfavourable year, on the other hand, retards emergence, and the moths do
  not come up until late June or mid-July; such has been the case this year
  (1907).</p>

  <p>Generally distributed and by no means uncommon throughout the southern
  half of England, but somewhat local northwards. It has been recorded from
  the most southern counties of Scotland, and Kane states that in Ireland
  it is widely distributed but usually scarce.</p>

  <p>The method of folding down its wings in repose is very similar to that
  of the previous two species.</p>

<h5><b>The Death's-head Hawk Moth</b> (<i>Acherontia (Manduca)
atropos</i>).</h5>

  <p>The fine moth represented on Plate <a href="#plate8">8</a> is the
  largest species found in the British Isles, although in measurement from
  tip to tip when the wings are expanded it does not exceed that of the
  next species, both varying in this respect from 4½ to 5 inches. It is,
  however, a stouter bodied insect, and its wings are broader. The colour
  and markings are so well shown in the illustration that a description is
  unnecessary. Beyond a greater or lesser intensity of the paler markings
  on the fore wings and the thorax, also some modifications in the black
  band of the hind wings, there is nothing very striking in the way of
  variation. Perhaps the most important aberrations are connected with the
  inner black band of the hind wings, which may be much widened and
  diffuse, or, on the other hand, entirely absent.</p>

  <p>When full grown, the caterpillar attains a length of nearly 5 inches,
  and is of considerable thickness throughout. Usually <!-- Page 25
  --><span class="pagenum" title="043.png"><a
  name="page25"></a>{25}</span>the general colour is some shade of green,
  varying to yellowish, but in some examples it is brown, more or less
  tinged with violet; others again are of a blackish hue. The seven oblique
  side stripes are purplish or violet brown, edged with yellowish; they are
  absent from the three rings nearest the head; the rough, double curved
  horn is of the body colour. The greenish forms are sprinkled with violet
  dots, and the brownish forms with white ones. Most frequently found on
  the leaves of potato; it feeds also on the "tea-tree" (<i>Lycium
  barbarum</i>), woody nightshade (<i>Solanum dulcamara</i>), and snowberry
  (<i>Symphoricarpus</i>). Fig. 1, Plate <a href="#plate9">9</a>,
  represents the brown form of the caterpillar.</p>

  <p>When ready to enter the chrysalis state, the caterpillar burrows from
  2 to 4 inches below the surface of the soil, and there forms a large
  chamber, the walls of which are not very substantial and are easily
  broken. After resting therein for a week, or two, it turns to a dark
  brownish, rather glossy, chrysalis. (Plate <a href="#plate11">11</a>,
  Fig. 1). The earthen cocoon, frail as it is, seems to be a protection to
  the chrysalis, guarding it from too much moisture on the one hand, or
  dryness on the other. I always found that when chrysalids from
  caterpillars that I have obtained were left undisturbed the moths emerged
  well enough; but when they were turned up out of the ground by the potato
  diggers, and, of course, without covering, they were almost certain to
  perish if the attempt were made to keep them through the winter. In the
  latter case, the only chance was to endeavour to induce the moth to
  emerge as soon as possible by bringing them under the combined influence
  of warmth and moisture.</p>

  <p>This species was known to Mouffett, who figured it in 1634, but it
  does not appear to have received an English name until 1773, when Wilkes
  figured it as the "Jasmine Hawk Moth." Moses Harris, in 1775, called it
  the "Bee Tyger Hawk Moth," but three years later he changed the name to
  the Death's Head, the name by which it is still known, although in some
  <!-- Page 26 --><span class="pagenum" title="044.png"><a
  name="page26"></a>{26}</span>parts of England, as well as in Ireland, it
  is referred to as the "bee robber." In connection with the latter name,
  it may be mentioned that the moth's "tongue," or proboscis, is short, and
  not adapted for obtaining sweets, of which it is very fond, from
  long-tubed flowers, consequently it filches honey from the bees, and,
  with this object, has been known to enter bee-hives, at least those of
  the old straw-skep pattern. The moth is also said to have a liking for
  the sap exuded by wounded trees. Although the species may, perhaps, be
  with us in certain favoured localities every year, it does not often
  occur, in any stage, in numbers sufficient to attract general attention.
  I have not searched the chronicles of <i>Atropos</i> in Britain earlier
  than 1864, but from these it seems that the species was widely
  distributed and generally common in 1865, 1868, 1878, 1885, 1896, and
  1900. More or less common in certain localities in 1867, 1869, 1870-1872,
  1877, 1880, 1882, 1884, 1893, 1895, 1899, 1911, and 1917. In the other
  years it was scarce, or apparently absent.</p>

  <p>The moth is always very much less in evidence than the caterpillar, or
  even the chrysalis. Sometimes the former is seen in May or June, or even
  earlier, and it has been supposed that these precocious specimens have
  hibernated after emergence from the chrysalis here during the previous
  autumn. The question of hibernation need not be entertained, but there
  may be doubt as to whether the specimens are British born or aliens. I am
  inclined to the latter view. The moths are often noted at sea long
  distances from land. A specimen was captured on board a vessel in the
  North Sea on April 28, 1903, and it was still alive, although it had been
  roughly dealt with, on May 8 of that year. In 1899 a moth was taken at
  Chester, about the middle of May, and one on June 20 at Chichester.
  Probably, although undetected, other specimens were also about the
  country, and maybe at even earlier dates than those recorded. However,
  during the year larvæ and pupæ were found, at the end of July, at
  Chilton, Suffolk, and at Bridgwater, Somerset, and in early August in
  Somerset, and at Dover. A moth was captured in August at Marlow, Bucks.,
  one was taken at Christchurch on September 19, one at Reigate, September
  25. Several specimens occurred in Devon and Cornwall in the autumn, and
  at Deal early in October. Larvæ were found, too, from the second week in
  September to the end of that month in several parts of the country. Moths
  seem to have been reared in early September from the early August
  caterpillars; whilst the September caterpillars attained the perfect
  state towards the end of the month and in October. Two pupæ, found at
  Penarth on September 12, produced moths in from four to six days
  afterwards; four other chrysalids, obtained in Hants about mid September,
  yielded moths between September 21 and the beginning of October.</p>

  <p>From the foregoing there can be no question that there are at least
  two generations of the moth in some years, and in our own country, but we
  have even clearer evidence of this in the records of 1900, when a moth
  was taken in the spring at Ayton, Berwickshire, another at Worsborough
  Bridge on June 18, and a third at Kilmarnock, on a bee-hive, July 11.
  Caterpillars were found during late July and August in South Scotland and
  various parts of England, and moths were reared from some of these. In
  September and October caterpillars were found more commonly, and two or
  three moths were captured, in various places, between August 19 and
  October 9; others, reared from September caterpillars, emerged from
  October 30 to November 24.</p>

  <p>By the rustic, and possibly the uninitiated generally, the moth is
  looked upon as something uncanny. This is probably due to the fact that
  the creature, when handled, emits a peculiar sound that has been
  described as a shrill squeak. According to Kirby, the statement made by
  Rossi that the sound is produced by air from the air-sacs being forced
  through the <!-- Page 28 --><span class="pagenum" title="048.png"><a
  name="page28"></a>{28}</span>proboscis, has been verified. Another
  dread-inspiring character of the insect is the marking on the thorax,
  which has been likened to a skull and crossbones. The squeak is said to
  have the effect of quieting the bees, they being under the impression
  that it proceeds from their queen.</p>

  <p>It has been taken at some time or another in almost every part of the
  British Isles, right up to and including the Shetlands. Except that it
  has not been observed in the more northern parts, the species is found
  throughout Europe, North and South Africa, the Canary Islands, and the
  Azores. It is also represented in Southern India, extending to the
  Malays, and in China, Corea, and Japan.</p>

<h5><b>Convolvulus Hawk-moth</b>, <i>Herse</i> (<i>Sphinx</i>) <i>convolvuli</i>.</h5>

  <p>The older writers on British moths called this the "Unicorn" or
  "Bindweed Hawk." The fore wings are whitish grey, mottled with darker
  tints, and, in the male, clouded with blackish about the middle of the
  wing; the central third is limited inwardly by a double blackish, wavy
  line, and outwardly by an irregular, toothed, whitish line; running from
  one to the other are two black streaks between the veins, and a similar
  streak nearer the costa is waved upwards to the tip of the wing. The hind
  wings are whitish grey, with a black stripe near the base, and two
  blackish bands between the stripe and the outer margin. The thorax agrees
  in colour with the fore wings; the tapered body has a broad grey stripe,
  enclosing a central black line along the back, broad red and black and
  narrow white bands on each side (Plate <a href="#plate10">10</a>).</p>

  <p>The egg has been described as bright green in colour, and smaller than
  that of the Privet Hawk. A female moth captured at Brighton on July 18,
  1898, deposited twenty-five eggs on <i>Convolvulus arvensis</i> up to
  July 20, and the next day a further eight were counted. The moth died on
  the 22nd. Caterpillars hatched out July 27-28. These were whitish green,
  with a rough blackish horn; after second moult they became green, with a
  darker green stripe along the back, but without oblique side stripes.</p>

  <p>In its more usual form the caterpillar, when full grown, is bright
  apple-green, narrowly streaked with black; oblique stripes on the sides
  yellowish; horn reddish, tip black. Head green, with black stripes. In
  some examples the side stripes are edged above with bluish black; in
  others there are blackish, more or less square, spots on the back, and
  patches on the sides. Sometimes the general colour is blackish brown,
  with ochreous bands and streaks. (This form is figured on Plate <a
  href="#plate9">9</a>). When it occurs in these islands it is generally
  found on the small bindweed (<i>Convolvulus arvensis</i>), but it will
  eat <i>C. sepium</i> and <i>C. soldanella</i>, and also the cultivated
  kinds.</p>

  <p>Referring to the caterpillar in Britain, Moses Harris, in 1775, wrote,
  "I never heard of but two that were ever found&mdash;one by Mr. South [or
  Smith] of Hampshire, which, he said, was green, and appeared in other
  respects so like the privet that he was deceived. He fed it on the leaves
  of the lesser bindweed. It changed into the chrysalis in the earth, in
  July, and the moth was produced in September" (Dale).</p>

  <p>The caterpillar figured by Harris is of the brown form, so we see that
  even at this early date something was known of the life history of this
  moth and the variation of the caterpillar. Since that date and up to 1894
  only very few larvæ appear to have been found in our islands. Barrett
  states that it is doubtful if more than twenty had then been recorded. In
  1895 caterpillars were obtained in Cornwall (four) and in Kent (two).
  Then for five years little or nothing was reported about this stage,
  although the moth seems to have occurred in varying numbers each year. In
  1901, August and September, over one hundred were reported, rather more
  than half of which were taken from a hedgerow, overgrown with <i>C.
  sepium</i>, in <!-- Page 30 --><span class="pagenum" title="052.png"><a
  name="page30"></a>{30}</span>Northumberland; twenty-six were obtained on
  the bindweed growing on Lancashire sandhills, thirteen or fourteen in
  Essex, and others in Bedfordshire, Kent, Hants, Dorset, and Devon.</p>

  <p>Mr. Bell-Marley obtained thirty eggs, September, 1897, and although
  these were kept in a cold room, thirteen caterpillars hatched, September
  21. They were supplied with <i>Convolvulus arvensis</i> and <i>C.
  soldanella</i>, and seemed to relish one as much as the other. Seven died
  during the first three moults. The bindweeds being nearly over, seedlings
  were raised by forcing, but before these were ready the larvæ had been on
  short commons, and just immediately before the seedlings came to hand,
  had been twenty-four hours without food. On these tender seedlings and
  some endive the remaining larvæ, six in number, attained full growth in
  December. Two subsequently died in the first half of that month, and the
  others went under the soil. Only one, however, managed to assume the
  chrysalis state.</p>

  <p>A small caterpillar, about one week old, described by
  Paymaster-in-Chief G. F. Mathew ("Notes on Lepidoptera from the
  Mediterranean," <i>Entom.</i>, xxxi. 115), was 1¾ inch long, pale
  glaucous green in colour, and thickly covered with raised white dots;
  oblique side stripes white, bordered above with dark green. On September
  26, 1897, this caterpillar, which had been found on September 18, was
  nearly full grown, and the writer goes on to state that when gathering
  bindweed he obtained either eggs or tiny caterpillars at the same time,
  and he eventually found that he had eight of them altogether. They fed up
  rapidly, as a caterpillar, hatched about September 27, had gone down on
  October 18. Owing to accident, four produced deformed chrysalids, but
  each chrysalis resulting from the others was perfect and healthy on
  February 15, 1898. The large reddish-brown chrysalis is figured on Plate
  <a href="#plate11">11</a>, and it will be noted that the "tongue" case
  forms a curious bent projection not unlike the handle of a pitcher. To
  give some idea of the irregular way in which this migratory species
  visits our islands, it will suffice to note the records only since 1894.
  Previous to that year it was common, more or less generally, in 1846,
  1868, 1875, 1885, and 1887.</p>

  <p>In 1895 an invasion seems to have effected a landing in the autumn, on
  the south-west coast, chiefly, perhaps, in the Portland district, where
  some fifty individuals were captured between August 12 and October 7;
  twenty-three were caught near Bournemouth in August and September;
  sixteen were taken at Christchurch, August 11 to October 2; and eight
  were recorded from Milford. Several were reported from Devon, but only
  two from Cornwall, although four larvæ were found in October at Port
  Wrinkle in the latter county. At Cork, in Ireland, ten specimens were
  obtained in October. Eastward, the captures in September were Norfolk
  (seven), Essex (one), Lincoln (one). Odd specimens were taken here and
  there in Kent, Surrey, and Herts. Several were reported from
  Gloucestershire, and one from South Wales. The northward extension was
  evidenced by the capture of one example at Alnwick, in Northumberland, in
  September, and of two in Aberdeenshire, one as early as August 31, the
  other September 9.</p>

  <p>The moth was almost a defaulter in 1896, but in 1897 about forty
  specimens were taken, twenty-seven of which occurred in the Scilly Isles
  and eleven at Portland (August 14 to September 16). One example was
  reported from Yorkshire and another from Sutherlandshire, both in
  September.</p>

  <p>A female was taken at Brighton, July 18, 1898, and in the autumn of
  that year a good many specimens were obtained in various parts of England
  but chiefly in the south. Portland again heading the list with over fifty
  (August 4 to October 3) and a number were taken in the Isle of Wight
  during September. Captures in 1899 seem to have been only pretty good.
  Portland twenty, August 25 to September 20, perhaps less than a dozen in
  other parts of England and one in Scotland, all in September <!-- Page 32
  --><span class="pagenum" title="056.png"><a
  name="page32"></a>{32}</span>or October. In 1900 one specimen was taken
  at an Eastbourne electric light, and one at Portpatrick in Scotland, both
  end of August. There appears to have been an arrival of moths in this
  country in early June, 1901. Captures were reported from Portland (June
  2), Bedford, and S. W. London. Larvæ and pupæ were found in many parts of
  England, as already mentioned. Then in August, from about the 14th to
  September, moths were captured throughout the greater part of England; in
  some places caterpillars were also obtained in August, chrysalids in
  September. After a lull towards the end of the latter month, moths
  suddenly appeared again during the first week in October. Several
  observers remarked that whereas the August to September moths were mostly
  females, large in size, and not in the best condition, the later moths
  were chiefly of the male sex, small in size, and fine in condition. It
  would seem therefore that these late specimens were the descendants of
  the early August moths and represented a second generation on British
  soil and the grandchildren of the June immigrants. Or, possibly, the
  August-September moths were fresh immigrants, and the October specimens
  their offspring.</p>

  <p>The species was observed in several English counties during August and
  September, 1911; and again in 1915. In 1917 it seems to have been more
  widely spread over our islands, as specimens were reported from Ireland
  and even Shetland.</p>

  <p>Plants with tubular flowers, such as those of petunias, and the
  sweet-scented white tobacco (<i>Nicotiana affinis</i>) are its especial
  favourites, but it also visits the blossoms of pentstemon, geranium
  (chiefly the scarlet variety), etc. It does not settle on the flowers but
  inserts its long "tongue" into the tubes as it hovers on the wing in
  front of them. Just at twilight it commences operations, but it may be
  seen pursuing its investigations well on into the night (see Fig. 1, p.
  2).</p>

  <p>Distributed over Europe, Asia, and Africa. <!-- Page 33 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="057.png"><a name="page33"></a>{33}</span></p>

<h5><b>The Privet Hawk</b> (<i>Sphinx ligustri</i>).</h5>

  <p>A specimen of the female sex is figured on Plate <a
  href="#plate12">12</a>. The white clouding or mottling on the pale brown
  colour of the fore wings varies in intensity and is sometimes tinged with
  pink, especially at the base of the wings; often it is only noticeable at
  the tips of the wings and on the outer area; the blackish suffusion from
  the inner margin through the central area and the black streaks between
  the veins are rather more constant. On the hind wings the pinkish tinge
  between the black bands may be faint or entirely absent; the central
  black band varies in width, and is sometimes so much expanded that it
  absorbs the basal half of the first band.</p>

  <p>When full grown the caterpillar measures about three inches in length
  and has a very substantial appearance. It is of a pretty green colour,
  with seven oblique white stripes, each of which has a purplish front
  edging; the spiracles are yellowish. The head is rather more grass green
  and marked with black in front. The curved horn is blackish on the upper
  side and yellowish below. The colour of the caterpillar in its younger
  stage is yellowish, due to the presence of yellow dots, it also has some
  tiny hairs; the horn, which is bristly and slightly forked at the tip, is
  a conspicuous feature at this age on account of its length and dark
  colour as compared with that of the creature itself. Just before changing
  into the chrysalis, a brownish tinge is assumed, and very rarely
  caterpillars of a pinkish or purplish tint have been found.</p>

  <p>It feeds on privet (<i>Ligustrum vulgare</i>) in July and August;
  often to be seen resting on the upper part of the longer sprays of the
  food plant. Sometimes a dozen or more may be found on one short strip of
  privet hedge. They are much subject to the attack of ichneumons. Other
  food plants are lilac, ash, lauristinus, and some other shrubs. Mr. Step
  informs me that on <!-- Page 34 --><span class="pagenum" title="058.png"
  ><a name="page34"></a>{34}</span>August 18, 1907, he found three larvæ
  feeding on teasel at Ashtead.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar will burrow some depth underground before constructing
  its pupal chamber. The chrysalis, which is reddish, or blackish-brown in
  colour, is figured with the other stages on Plate <a
  href="#plate13">13</a>.</p>

  <p>The moth usually emerges the following June or July, but there are at
  least two records of its remaining in the chrysalis during two
  winters.</p>

  <p>The southern portion of England appears to be the principal British
  home of this moth. It is more or less scarce in the midlands and
  northwards. In Scotland it has only been recorded from southern counties,
  and in his "Catalogue of the Lepidoptera of Ireland," Kane states that he
  has no certain record of its occurrence in that country. Widely
  distributed through central and southern Europe, extending northwards to
  south Sweden and Finland, and eastwards to Amurland, China, and
  Japan.</p>

<h5><b>The Pine Hawk</b> (<i>Hyloicus pinastri</i>).</h5>

  <p>Stephens, writing of this species in 1828, remarked that about thirty
  years before that date, a specimen "was taken in June at Colney Hatch
  Wood, and a second in the neighbourhood of Esher." He also gives
  Rivelston Wood, near Edinburgh, as a locality, on the authority of Dr.
  Leach. A specimen was stated to have been seen in Cumberland in 1827 or
  1828, and up to the year 1877 four other examples were reported, each
  from a different part of England. In the year last mentioned a specimen
  was recorded from Woodbridge, Suffolk, as taken in a rectory garden the
  previous midsummer (since ascertained that the moth was first seen there
  in 1875); an example was also found at rest on a tree trunk at Tuddenham,
  near Ipswich, in July, 1877, and one was reared on August 5, 1876, from a
  <!-- Page 35 --><span class="pagenum" title="059.png"><a
  name="page35"></a>{35}</span>chrysalis found near Horham Rectory, Wickham
  Market, Suffolk. In 1878-9, caterpillars were met with at Leiston,
  Suffolk; the moth was found in the pine woods around Aldeburgh, 1881, and
  as many as forty specimens were taken in July and August, 1882, and
  rather more than twenty in August, 1919. In 1895, Lord Rendlesham, when
  driving through the fir woods in the neighbourhood of Woodbridge, noted
  two specimens in almost the same spot where he had taken some moths in
  1892-93. Mr. F. Mellusson, writing from this district (August 2, 1895),
  stated that fifteen specimens had been taken, and that others could have
  been captured; also that about one hundred larvæ were then feeding in
  confinement. He also mentioned that 1895 was the fourth year out of five
  that the insect had occurred there. A male moth was found at rest on an
  oak trunk near Southwold, Suffolk, on July 29, 1900. On August 13, 1906,
  the Rev. A. P. Waller saw a worn specimen on a pine trunk in the rectory
  garden at Woodbridge. He also noted a pupa on September 30, 1917. (Plate
  <a href="#plate12">12</a>, Fig. 2.)</p>

  <p>The mature caterpillar, which feeds on pine needles, is green, with a
  yellowish-edged reddish line along the middle of the back and a creamy
  line on each side of this; the interrupted line below the reddish
  spiracles is yellowish or ochreous. Head yellowish brown; horn blackish
  brown; both are glossy. It enters the earth and there turns to a reddish
  brown chrysalis; this is rather glossy, somewhat darker above than below,
  and appearing blackish between the rings; the rough "tongue" sheath is
  short and attached throughout to the case; the tail spike is roughened,
  and has a blunt point on each side of it (Plate <a
  href="#plate11">11</a>, Figs. 3, 3<i>a</i>).</p>

  <p>It has been recorded that caterpillars hatched from the egg early in
  August, pupated in October, and the moths emerged the following
  May-July.</p>

  <p>The perfect insect sits upon tree trunks, chiefly pine, often well
  within reach, although sometimes its position is fourteen or <!-- Page 36
  --><span class="pagenum" title="060.png"><a
  name="page36"></a>{36}</span>fifteen feet up the trunk. At night it
  visits flowers, and seems to be most partial to those of the
  honeysuckle.</p>

  <p>Suffolk seems to be the British home of this species, but odd
  specimens have been reported since 1860 from Romsey, Hampshire; Hinton
  St. George, Somersetshire; Herefordshire; Isle of Mull (two
  caterpillars); and Bournemouth.</p>

  <p>The range of this species is through Northern and Central Europe
  southwards to Northern Spain and Italy, and eastward to the Caucasus. In
  Japan it is represented by var. <i>caligineus</i>, Butler, which differs
  but little from typical <i>pinastri</i>.</p>

<h5><b>The Spurge Hawk</b> (<i>Deilephila</i> (<i>Hyles</i>) <i>euphorbiæ</i>).</h5>

  <p>The fore wings are pale grey, more or less tinged with pinkish and
  marked with olive at the base, towards the middle of front margin, and a
  tapered band running from the inner margin to the tip of the wing; the
  lower part of the basal patch is blackish. Hind wings pinkish with black
  basal patch and a band before the outer margin; a white patch at anal
  angle (Plate <a href="#plate15">15</a>, Fig. 1).</p>

  <p>The caterpillar feeds, August and September, on spurge (<i>Euphorbia
  paralias</i>, and <i>E. cyparissias</i>). When full grown the head is
  crimson red, marked on the crown with black; the body is black, but so
  thickly sprinkled with yellow dots that much of the black colour is
  obscured; the larger spots are often crimson, but sometimes they are
  yellow, or even cream coloured; the stripes along the back and below the
  yellow spiracles are crimson, as also are the legs and feet; the spiny
  horn is crimson with a black tip. In a younger stage the head and the
  horn are orange, the latter black tipped; the body is yellow with patches
  of black around the paler yellow spots on the back. Chrysalis pale
  brownish, minutely dotted with black; the head and thorax are marked with
  blackish, and the rings of the body have narrow, interrupted, blackish
  bands; the wing and antennæ cases are covered with fine short blackish
  streaks; tail spike blackish, somewhat flattened, and the acute point
  black (Plate <a href="#plate1">1</a>, Fig. 1; <a href="#plate14">14</a>,
  Figs. 2, 2<i>a</i>).</p>

  <p>The moth usually emerges in June or July of the year following
  pupation, but it may come out the same year; on the other hand, it has
  been known to remain in the chrysalis for two winters. Dr. Chapman has
  noted the emergence of the moth eighteen days after the pupa was
  formed.</p>

  <p>Little, if anything, appears to have been known of this species as an
  inhabitant of Britain until 1806, when Mr. Raddon, who was staying at
  Instow, in N. Devon, had a caterpillar brought to him by a fisherman.
  From that time, and up to 1814, a large number of the caterpillars were
  obtained from <i>Euphorbia paralias</i> growing on Braunton Burrows, a
  long stretch of sandhills on the north Devonshire coast, accessible from
  Barnstaple or Ilfracombe, which, when I visited the locality some
  twenty-five years ago, was greatly favoured by rabbits. One would suppose
  that the Spurge Hawk caterpillars must have been pretty abundant at the
  time Raddon made his observations, as he states in a note on the subject
  published in the Entomological Magazine for 1835, that on leaving the
  ground one evening at dusk he hastily cut an armful of spurge, which he
  took home and put in water. Next morning he "found the food covered with
  not less than a hundred minute larvæ about a day or two old." This must
  have happened prior to 1814, because the species seems to have entirely
  disappeared about that year. The Rev. E. N. Bloomfield, in his catalogue
  of the Lepidoptera of Suffolk, mentions a moth bred from a larva found
  near Landguard Fort about 1865. He adds that the food plant was then
  abundant there. At a meeting of the Entomological Society of London held
  in October, 1876, a letter was read from Mr. Higgins concerning the
  reported finding of the caterpillars of this species in a locality near
  Harwich in 1873. It was stated that the spurge (<i>Euphorbia
  paralias</i>), had not only been <!-- Page 38 --><span class="pagenum" title="064.png"
  ><a name="page38"></a>{38}</span>seen in the particular spot, but in
  other parts of the same district also.</p>

  <p>In the <i>Entomologist</i> for 1893 there is a very circumstantial
  account of the finding of eighteen or nineteen Spurge Hawk caterpillars
  on the Cornish coast in the autumn of 1889. From these, eight moths
  resulted in May-July, 1890, and one in June, 1891.</p>

  <p>Although the occurrence of the moth in Britain has been more
  frequently recorded, probably in error for the Bedstraw Hawk, there are
  at least two that are undoubtedly authentic. One of these refers to a
  specimen taken in a private garden near Southampton (<i>Entom.</i>,
  1872), and the other was captured by the late Mr. C. G. Barrett as it
  flew at early dusk in a garden at King's Lynn, Norfolk, in September,
  1887. Some idea of the scarcity of <i>bonâ fide</i> English specimens may
  be gained from the fact that about thirteen years ago, two of Raddon's
  bred specimens were sold by auction at Stevens, when six guineas was
  given for one, and ten shillings more for the other.</p>

  <p>Its distribution abroad extends through Central and Southern Europe
  into Asia Minor, and it is represented by local races in other parts of
  Asia.</p>

<h5><b>The Bedstraw Hawk</b> (<i>Deilephila</i> (<i>Celerio</i>) <i>galii</i>).</h5>

  <p>On Plate <a href="#plate15">15</a>, Fig. 2, will be found a portrait
  of this moth, which the ancient fathers of British entomology dubbed the
  "Spotted Elephant"&mdash;at least, Harris, in 1778, figured its
  caterpillar under this name. Later it was called the "Galium Hawk-moth."
  The olive-brown fore wings have a tapered, creamy-white stripe running
  obliquely from the inner margin near the base to the tip of the wing; the
  lower edge of this stripe is almost straight, but the upper edge is
  irregular; the outer margin of the wings is greyish. Hind wings creamy
  <!-- Page 39 --><span class="pagenum" title="065.png"><a
  name="page39"></a>{39}</span>white, the basal area and a band before the
  outer margin black; the space enclosed is blotched, and sometimes tinged
  with pinkish red; but the extreme inner portion is almost pure white.
  Head and thorax are olive-brown, edged with white; the abdomen is
  olive-brown, with a whitish line along the middle of the back, and
  ornamented with black and white on the sides.</p>

  <p>The full-grown caterpillar varies in colour from greenish olive to
  pale olive-brown, reddish brown, or sometimes blackish; the spots on the
  back are yellowish, edged with black, but occasionally these are absent.
  It feeds in August and September, on the bedstraws (<i>Galium verum</i>,
  <i>G. mollugo</i>, etc.), preferring the yellow-flowered kind that
  flourishes on sandhills by the sea (<i>G. verum</i>, var.
  <i>maritimum</i>). It can be reared very well on willow herb
  (<i>Epilobium</i>) and on fuchsia.</p>

  <p>When ready for the change it burrows underground, and, where the soil
  is sandy and light, it works down pretty deeply before making the frail
  cell, in which it turns to a reddish-brown chrysalis with blackish
  markings, somewhat similar to those of the next species; the anal spike
  is blackish, rather flattened, terminating in a sharp point (Plate <a
  href="#plate14">14</a>, Figs. 1, 1<i>a</i>). Haworth in 1812 mentioned
  caterpillars from Devonshire, and although single specimens of the moth
  seem to have been taken here and there in various years between that date
  and 1854, in only one year during that period was it reported from
  several parts of the country. This was in 1834, when four moths were
  captured in August, and eight or nine others seen at Yarmouth;
  caterpillars were also found on the bedstraw growing on the Denes. Odd
  examples of the moth were observed that year in Lincolnshire,
  Somersetshire, and in the Isle of Wight. In 1855-56, caterpillars were
  obtained in August on the sandhills at Deal, and, in September, at
  Devonport in the first-named year. A moth was taken in May, 1857, and,
  later in that year, specimens were captured at Deal, <!-- Page 40
  --><span class="pagenum" title="066.png"><a
  name="page40"></a>{40}</span>Brighton, and Taunton. Three moths were
  recorded in 1858; and in 1859 caterpillars were plentiful on the
  south-east coast, common on the Cheshire coast, also reported from Devon,
  Cambs., London, and Darlington; over a score were found within a short
  distance of Perth. A good many moths were also taken. The species was
  especially abundant in 1870, in which year caterpillars were collected in
  hundreds. It seems to have been widely distributed throughout England,
  and was again found in Perthshire. Perhaps not more than three specimens
  were taken between 1872 and 1888, but in the rainy and cold summer of the
  latter year, the moths seem to have invaded the country in great force,
  and were reported from many parts of England, and also from Aberdeen in
  Scotland, and from Howth in Ireland. Caterpillars, too, were plentiful on
  the coast sandhills of Kent, Cheshire, and Lancashire, and also in the
  Eastern Counties.</p>

  <p>In March, 1889, Mr. Elisha had moths emerge from chrysalids of the
  previous year. These had been placed in a temperature ranging from 60 to
  70 degrees, and the moths came out in from fourteen to sixteen days after
  commencing the forcing process. Some half a dozen chrysalids that I had
  in 1888, from Lancashire caterpillars, were allowed to remain in the
  earth, which was contained in a large-sized flower-pot; the moths emerged
  in May and June, 1889, all but one being perfect specimens.</p>

  <p>In 1894 Mr. Harwood obtained five caterpillars on the Essex coast, and
  in 1897 the Rev. A. Miles Moss found a few, and observed traces of
  others, on the Lancashire coast, but, apart from these records, very few
  moths or caterpillars of this species appear to have been noted in the
  country since 1888, and we still await the advent of another <i>Galii</i>
  year. So far the periods of scarcity between the seasons of plenty have
  been twenty-five, eleven, and nineteen years.</p>

  <p>The range of this insect extends through Europe and Asia to <!-- Page
  41 --><span class="pagenum" title="067.png"><a
  name="page41"></a>{41}</span>Siberia and Amurland. It is represented in
  North America by the Galium Sphinx (<i>Celerio intermedia</i>, Kirby =
  <i>chamænerii</i>, Harris), which so greatly resembles it that only an
  expert could readily distinguish one from the other.</p>

<h5><b>The Striped Hawk</b> (<i>Phryxus</i> (<i>Deilephila</i>) <i>livornica</i>).</h5>

  <p>Owing to some confusion between this moth (Plate <a
  href="#plate15">15</a>, Fig. 3) and the North American Striped Morning
  Sphinx (<i>D. lineata</i>), which also seems to have had a place in the
  cabinets of the earlier British entomologists, the localities given by
  authors previous to 1828 are doubtful. Haworth, however, in 1803,
  mentions Cornwall, and Stephens, in his remarks on this species, refers
  to a specimen from Norfolk; one taken off the mast of the Ramsgate steam
  vessel at Billingsgate, in June, 1824; and three specimens, one of which
  he figured, captured near Kingsbridge, Devonshire.</p>

  <p>In 1846 thirteen of these moths were recorded from various parts of
  England and Ireland, and probably many others were in these islands that
  year. Between May 12 and 26, 1860, twenty specimens were taken in the
  south of England, and more than half of them in Devonshire. In 1862 a
  specimen occurred at Worthing on April 16, and one at Herne Hill on April
  29; others were taken between May 2 and May 18 on the south and
  south-west coasts, and at Colchester. Over a score of specimens were
  recorded in 1868, chiefly in August, and from localities ranging from
  Cornwall to Yorkshire. The year 1870 was a good one for the species, and
  moths were reported from England, Wales, Ireland, and Scotland. Fully
  fifty specimens were obtained, mostly in May, and caterpillars were also
  found. In 1904 the moth occurred in May, at several places in the south
  and south-west of England, also in Gloucestershire, Wales, and at
  Carlisle; in September of this year a specimen was taken on the pier at
  Dover, and another on a small <!-- Page 42 --><span class="pagenum" title="068.png"
  ><a name="page42"></a>{42}</span>headland at Barry, in Glamorgan. Some of
  the early captured females deposited eggs; caterpillars resulting
  therefrom were fed on vine, and at least one moth was reared in
  September.</p>

  <p>A good many specimens visited the south of England, more particularly
  South Devon, in June, 1906, but the species was reported as occurring in
  large numbers on rhododendron blossom near Cork in Ireland from June 9 to
  13 or 14. In August and September the moth was reported from Kent,
  Sussex, Hants, Dorset, Devon, Somerset, and South Wales; such specimens
  probably being the offspring of the early immigrants. During the past
  forty years the barren seasons for the Striped Hawk appear to have been
  only ten. The dates of its occurrence have been somewhat erratic. One was
  captured in 1887 in the month of February, one on March 27 in 1903, but
  the moth has been observed in each month from May to September inclusive,
  although May, June, and August would seem to have been the more favoured.
  The caterpillar has not been seen often in England. Mr. Farn recorded six
  or seven from Ryde in July, 1870; they were feeding on vine and centaury
  in a garden. One spun up in the leaves at the bottom of the box on July
  27, but the web was so fragile that the caterpillar fell out, and changed
  to the chrysalis state on the 30th. The moth emerged on August 26. In the
  same year several caterpillars occurred in Devon and Cornwall, and one of
  these was found on July 11 in a mangold-wurtzel field in the Exeter
  district. It was afterwards reared on fuchsia, and produced a moth on
  August 18. Nine others were reported from a nursery garden at Plymouth;
  they were fed up on dock&mdash;the plant upon which they had been
  found&mdash;and the moth was reared later in the year. In 1902 Mr. Jäger
  received a caterpillar from Starcross about July 20, and this attained
  the moth state on September 27. A caterpillar, believed to be of this
  species, was found in a sunny garden at Lewes in Sussex, July 20, 1906.
  <!-- Page 43 --><span class="pagenum" title="069.png"><a
  name="page43"></a>{43}</span></p>

  <p>According to Hellins the eggs are light green in colour, and the
  caterpillars hatch out in about three weeks. When it first emerges from
  the egg-shell the caterpillar is dirty white without spots, and the head
  and horn are black. The adult is dark green or black dotted with yellow;
  three yellow lines on the back and two rows of black-ringed yellow spots,
  with some black spots above them; each yellow spot is tinged with pink on
  the upper portion. Head black, marked with yellow; horn reddish, with the
  tip black. Sometimes the rings of the body are banded.</p>

  <p>It feeds in June and July on vine, fuchsia, dock, and probably other
  plants. It may be noted that the foliage of house vines are stated to be
  unsuitable food. The blossoms of numerous plants are visited by the moths
  in the evening, among which are delphinium, petunia, honeysuckle,
  tobacco, rhododendron, valerian, and silene.</p>

  <p>In the daytime it has been found resting on walls, windows, and also
  the curtains; on grass turf, railway metals, fences, and on plants and
  shrubs.</p>

  <p>The distribution of this species is somewhat similar to that of the
  Silver-striped Hawk-moth, but it extends into Western China and is
  represented in North America.</p>

<h5><b>The Silver-striped Hawk</b> (<i>Hippotion (Chærocampa)
celerio</i>).</h5>

  <p>Referring to this species in 1828 Stephens wrote: "The first recorded
  specimen of the perfect insect was taken flying in Bunhill-fields
  burying-ground so long ago as 1779: and the specimen now exists in a high
  state of preservation in Mr. Haworth's collection, having been purchased
  by him at the dispersion of that of Mr. Francillon. Subsequently to the
  above capture the larvæ have been found several times in
  Cambridgeshire.... Two or three were also taken about fifteen <!-- Page
  44 --><span class="pagenum" title="070.png"><a
  name="page44"></a>{44}</span>or sixteen years since in a garden at
  Norwich, and were kept until they changed to pupæ; but unfortunately, in
  that state their metamorphosis ended. One of these pupæ I have in my
  collection. Of late, however, the perfect insect has occurred more than
  once, and in totally different parts of the country. Three specimens, as
  I am informed by the Rev. F. W. Hope, were taken near Oxford several
  years ago. In August, 1826, an injured one was found resting on a wall
  near Birmingham; and last summer a second was secured not far distant
  from the same locality; the latter I have in my possession. Again, Mr.
  Marshall informed me in March last, that, on his way to Manchester, he
  met with an individual who possessed upwards of a dozen living pupæ,
  which were procured from larvæ found in that neighbourhood during last
  season."</p>

  <p>Humphrey and Westwood mention a specimen taken in Brighton in 1834,
  and in 1846 eight moths were obtained. Something like one hundred and
  twenty-five specimens of this species have been recorded between the year
  last quoted and the present time. Of these only one occurred in Ireland.
  This was a specimen taken at light on September 17, 1881, at Mullaghmore,
  County Sligo. Several were captured in Scotland, and one in Wales; but
  the bulk were obtained at various places in England, not in the south
  only but in the north also. The majority were met with in the autumn, but
  a specimen was reported as taken in May, 1848, at Harlestone, another in
  March, 1862, at Tooting, and a third in the Isle of Anglesea, July, 1865.
  In the last-named year nine specimens were captured in the autumn.
  Doubleday recorded a caterpillar found in a garden at Epping (October,
  1867), and other caterpillars have been reported from Newmarket and
  Sussex.</p>

  <p>At least one example of the moth has been recorded almost annually
  since 1846, but captures seem to have been more numerous in 1861, 1866,
  1870, 1879, 1881, and especially so in 1885. The caterpillar (figured on
  Plate <a href="#plate1">1</a>) varies in ground colour, which may be pale
  brown, dark brown, or green. There is a black line along the middle of
  the back, and a pinkish brown stripe on each side; the latter runs from
  the ring next the head to the horn, but is interrupted on ring four, and
  the back from this ring to the horn is covered with linear dots arranged
  in more or less regular rows; the underside is thickly sprinkled with
  black-ringed white dots; on each side of ring four there is a conspicuous
  oval mark made up of a blackish outer ring, an inner ring of yellowish,
  and one of reddish; the centre is blackish, with some yellowish dots upon
  it. Head small, pale brown; horn blackish and rather rough.</p>

  <p>It feeds on vine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) and yellow bedstraw
  (<i>Galium verum</i>); also on fuchsia and virginia-creeper
  (<i>Ampelopsis</i>). August and September are given as months for this
  caterpillar, but the Newmarket and Epping examples referred to were taken
  in October.</p>

  <p>The moth seems to visit us chiefly in September and October. It does
  not appear to have been so often taken at flowers as at light, or when
  resting by day, on a wall or window of a dwelling house or shop, to which
  it had been attracted at night by the illumination within. The species
  has a wide range through Africa and Southern Asia to Java, Borneo, and
  Australia. In Europe it is perhaps only native in southern parts; thence
  it sometimes wanders through Central Europe to Germany and Holland. The
  specimens visiting our islands may come from the latter country, or
  possibly in years of comparative plenty the moths come to us <i>viâ</i>
  the west coast of Europe.</p>

<h5><b>The Oleander Hawk-moth</b> (<i>Daphnis</i> (<i>Chærocampa</i>) <i>nerii</i>).</h5>

  <p>The forewings of this handsome moth (Plate <a href="#plate16">16</a>)
  are pinkish grey, marbled with various shades of green and olive brown;
  some of the marbling edged with white. Hind wings greyish <!-- Page 46
  --><span class="pagenum" title="074.png"><a
  name="page46"></a>{46}</span>brown shaded with greenish, with a whitish,
  waved cross line. The colours of the head, thorax, and body are similar
  to those of the wings.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center">(Photo by W. J. Lucas.)</p>
  </div>

  <p>The caterpillar feeds on the Oleander (<i>Nerium oleander</i>), and
  also on the lesser periwinkle (<i>Vinca minor</i>). When full grown it is
  olive green on the back from the hinder part of the third ring to the
  small, rough, and drooping, horn; the under surface and the whole of the
  first three rings ochreous; there is a divided brown spot on the ring
  nearest the head (first thoracic segment), and two larger blue-black
  spots on the third ring. These spots each enclose two whitish clouds; on
  the front edge of rings five to nine (second to sixth abdominal segments)
  are whitish dots, but these are fewer on rings eight and nine than on the
  others; a narrow whitish stripe, edged above and below with whitish dots,
  runs along the sides from ring five to the horn; spiracles are black with
  pale margins (Plate <a href="#plate1">1</a>).</p>

  <p>Chrysalis brown with blackish central line, which becomes broken and
  obscure on the body rings, broken again on the head, but continued thence
  along the under surface to the tips of the wing cases. The spiracles are
  blackish; the body is dotted, and the last rings are clouded with
  blackish.</p>

  <p>I have only seen a preserved example of this caterpillar and a dead
  chrysalis; descriptions of each are from these.</p>

  <p>The first published notification of the occurrence of this moth <!--
  Page 47 --><span class="pagenum" title="075.png"><a
  name="page47"></a>{47}</span>in England is that of Stephens in 1835. He
  wrote: "A noble specimen of this remarkably beautiful insect (five inches
  three lines in expanse), was taken in the beginning of September, 1833,
  by a lady in her drawing-room at Dover. Whether the pupa had been
  imported in some of the numerous packages of foreign fruits, etc., or the
  insect itself had been brought over in one of the passage-vessels, is a
  question not easily solved. The larva feeds upon an exotic plant; but has
  been found in a garden near Charmouth, as appears by a subsequent
  communication to the <i>Ent. Magazine</i> by Captain Blomer."</p>

  <p>The next record of the moth appears in the <i>Zoologist</i> for 1852.
  "On the 11th of September a specimen of <i>Chærocampa nerii</i> was taken
  in Montpelier Road, Brighton, by a young gentleman at school, while it
  was hovering over a passion flower." Two caterpillars were found in a
  garden at Eastbourne, feeding upon the leaves of potato, in October,
  1859. In confinement they ate periwinkle, but they were not reared. The
  following records are, except where otherwise stated, of single specimens
  of the moth: Hastings, August 2, 1862; Sheffield, September 14, 1867; St.
  Leonards, October, 1868 (? 2 examples); Ascot, June, 1873; Lewes,
  September 3, 1874; Hemel Hempstead, October 15, 1876; Tottenham,
  Middlesex, Eastbourne, Sussex, and Blandford, Dorset, September, 1884;
  Hartlepool and Prestwich, July, 1885; Brighton, September 7, 1886;
  Poplar, September 20, 1888; Dartmouth, September 26, 1890; Stowling,
  Kent, July, 1896; Yalding, Kent, September 18, Teignmouth, October 23,
  1900; Banhead, Scotland, end September, 1901; Liverpool, in a steamship,
  and Atherstone, Warwickshire, October, 1903; Eastbourne, July 14, 1904;
  Lancaster, September 18, 1906. A specimen of <i>Daphnis hypothous</i>,
  Cramer, a native of India, Borneo, Java, and Ceylon, was captured at
  Crieff, Perthshire, in July, 1873, and was recorded as <i>D. nerii</i>,
  and the error was not rectified until 1891.</p>

  <p>It will be seen from the above that the moth is exceedingly <!-- Page
  48 --><span class="pagenum" title="076.png"><a
  name="page48"></a>{48}</span>rare in these islands. The species is an
  inhabitant of Africa, and its normal range extends along both sides of
  the Mediterranean through Asia Minor and Syria to India. In Europe, north
  of the Alps, the moth is seldom observed, and it is probably almost as
  scarce on most of the Continent as it is with us.</p>

<h5><b>The Small Elephant</b> (<i>Metopsilus</i> (<i>Chærocampa</i>) <i>porcellus</i>).</h5>

  <p>The fore wings of this hawk-moth are ochreous with a faint olive
  tinge; the front margin is edged and blotched with pinkish, and there is
  a broad but irregular band of the same colour on the outer margin. Hind
  wings blackish on upper margin, pinkish on outer margin, and ochreous
  tinged with olive between; fringes chequered whitish, sometimes tinged
  with pink. Head, thorax, and body pinkish, more or less variegated with
  olive; the thorax has a patch of white hairs above the base of the wings
  (Plate <a href="#plate19">19</a>, Figs. 3, 4).</p>

  <p>In most specimens there are at least traces of two cross-lines in the
  fore wings, the space between these is sometimes brownish olive; the
  outer border of the hind wings varies in tint, and may be purplish.
  Occasionally the ground colour of the fore wings is greenish olive.</p>

  <p>A hybrid, resulting from a pairing between <i>Chærocampa elpenor</i>
  and <i>Metopsilus porcellus</i> has been named <i>elpenorcellus</i>
  (Staud).</p>

  <p>The egg is a rich full green and rather glossy; it is laid in June on
  yellow bedstraw and other kinds of <i>Galium</i>.</p>

  <p>A full-grown caterpillar will measure quite two inches in length, and
  in general appearance is not unlike that of the next species. It is,
  however, greyish brown in colour, merging into yellowish brown on the
  front rings. The head is greyer than the body; the usual Sphingid horn is
  absent, and in its place there is a double wart. When quite young the
  caterpillar is pale greyish green with blackish bristles, and the head
  and under surface are yellowish.</p>

  <p>It feeds, at night, in August and September, on bedstraw growing in
  dry places. It will eat almost any sort of <i>Galium</i>; also willow
  herb (<i>Epilobium</i>), and purple loosestrife (<i>Lythrum
  salicaria</i>).</p>

  <p>The chrysalis is pale ochreous brown sprinkled with darker brown; the
  wing cases and the ring divisions are also darker. The body rings are
  furnished with reddish hooks. It is enclosed in a cocoon similar to that
  of the Elephant, and usually is on the ground. The early stages are
  figured in Plate <a href="#plate18">18</a>.</p>

  <p>The moth, which chiefly affects drier localities than the next
  species, is on the wing in May and June in the south of England, and June
  and July in the north. It has a weakness for the flowers of honeysuckle,
  and spur-valerian (<i>Centranthus</i>), but will take toll in the way of
  sweets wherever found, even from the sugar patches of the nocturnal
  collector. Except that it does not appear frequently in the Midlands, the
  species seems to be widely distributed throughout the country. In
  Scotland its range extends to Perthshire and Aberdeen; and in Ireland it
  is found all over the island, and is fairly plentiful in some localities,
  but especially attached to the coast.</p>

  <p>Abroad, its distribution covers nearly the whole of Europe, and
  eastward to north-eastern Asia Minor, Bithynia, and the Altai.</p>

<h5><b>The Elephant</b> (<i>Chærocampa</i> (<i>Eumorpha</i>) <i>elpenor</i>).</h5>

  <p>The fore wings are olive brown with two pinkish lines, both shaded
  with dark olive brown; the first is rather broader than the second, and
  terminates just above the centre of the wing and near a white dot; the
  second line runs from the white inner margin to the tip of the wing, and
  the area beyond it is flushed with pinkish; there is a black mark at the
  base of the wings and the fringes are pinkish. The hind wings are black
  on the <!-- Page 50 --><span class="pagenum" title="080.png"><a
  name="page50"></a>{50}</span>basal half and pinkish on the outer half;
  fringes white. The head, thorax, and body are olive brown marked with
  pinkish, the thorax being additionally ornamented with white on the
  sides. The moth is shown on Plate <a href="#plate19">19</a>, and the
  early stages on Plate <a href="#plate17">17</a>.</p>

  <p>The eggs are whitish-green in colour and rather glossy. Those I had
  were laid in June on a leaf of willow herb (<i>Epilobium</i>).</p>

  <p>When newly hatched the caterpillar is yellowish white, and paler
  between the rings; the head is tinged with greenish, and the horn is
  black. The full-grown caterpillar measures nearly three inches in length,
  and is rather plump. It is blackish or brownish grey, thickly sprinkled
  with black dots on the back and more sparingly on the sides; the
  spiracles are ochreous ringed with blackish, and below them is an
  ochreous line, which is most distinct on the front rings; on each side of
  the third to fifth rings there is a round black spot, the second and
  third pairs enclosing black centred whitish lunules which are sometimes
  tinged with pink or yellow; the horn is much of the same colour as the
  body. There is a green form of this caterpillar.</p>

  <p>It feeds, chiefly, at night, in July and August, on <i>Epilobium
  hirsutum</i> and on bedstraw especially the kind (<i>G. palustre</i>),
  growing by the side of brooks and streams. The chrysalis is palish brown
  freckled with darker brown, the divisions between the rings and the
  spiked tail appearing blackish; enclosed in a cocoon formed of earth and
  sundry fragments of stalks, leaves, etc., spun together with silk and
  generally on the ground, but sometimes just under the surface.</p>

  <p>The moth is on the wing in June, and very occasionally there is a late
  summer emergence. It does not fly until dusk, and may then be seen
  hovering over the blossoms of honeysuckle, etc. It is also known to be
  attracted now and then to "sugared" trees. The best plan, however, for
  obtaining a few fine specimens <!-- Page 51 --><span class="pagenum" title="081.png"
  ><a name="page51"></a>{51}</span>is to rear them from eggs or
  caterpillars. The latter are said to come up to sun themselves about four
  o'clock in the afternoon, but they may be found at any time in their
  season, and in likely spots, by turning back the herbage and looking for
  them in their hiding-places. When in repose the head and front rings are
  drawn inwards, and this distends the eyed rings, thus bringing these into
  prominence and giving the creature a rather wicked look, from which the
  uninitiated would be likely to retreat. The caterpillar, however, is
  quite harmless, and may be handled with impunity.</p>

  <p>Although somewhat scarce in the more northern counties, this is a
  pretty common species throughout most of England and Wales. Its range
  extends into Scotland as far as Dumbarton, and, according to Barrett,
  along the east coast to Aberdeen. Kane states that in Ireland it is met
  with everywhere and is abundant in some localities. Distributed over
  Europe, except the more northern parts, and extending through Asia to
  Japan.</p>

<h5><b>The Humming-bird Hawk-moth</b> (<i>Macroglossa
stellatarum</i>).</h5>

  <p>The brown fore wings with black cross lines, and the brownish bordered
  orange hind wings, at once separate this from any other hawk-moth
  occurring in our islands. Its greenish eggs are laid on bedstraw, and in
  July and August the caterpillars may be found on the same kind of plant.
  They are greenish or brownish covered with white dots; a whitish line
  runs along each side of the back and a yellowish one lower down on the
  sides; the spiracles are blackish, and the horn bluish shading into
  yellow at the tip. The yellow-flowering bedstraw (<i>Galium verum</i>)
  seems to be the kind upon which the caterpillar is most often found, but
  it also occurs on the hedge bedstraw (<i>G. mollugo</i>). It has been
  known to eat wild madder (<i>Rubia peregrina</i>), and is <!-- Page 52
  --><span class="pagenum" title="082.png"><a
  name="page52"></a>{52}</span>stated to thrive in confinement on
  goose-grass or cleavers (<i>G. aparine</i>). When full grown a loosely
  woven cocoon is formed on the ground beneath the food plant, or other
  herbage, and therein the caterpillar changes to an ochreous grey or
  brownish chrysalis. This is marked with darker brown on the wing covers
  and around the spiracles; the "tongue" case forms a small beak-like
  projection.</p>

  <p>Like the Bee Hawks, referred to presently, the moth is a day flyer,
  and delights in the sunshine, although it has been several times seen on
  the wing quite late in the evening, and has also been observed hovering
  in front of flowers and probing them with its long "tongue" even in the
  pouring rain. Blossoms of very many plants, both wild and cultivated,
  seem to receive its attention, but it is perhaps most partial to those of
  the jasmine where available. In the south of Europe the species is
  generally abundant throughout the year; but there would seem to be at
  least two distinct broods, one appearing in June, and the other in
  October. Possibly there may be an intermediate brood in August, as the
  period from egg to moth is known to be less than two months. In the
  British Isles, so far as one can gather from the records, caterpillars
  have only been found in July and August. Single specimens of the moth
  have been seen in the earliest months of the year, as for example,
  January 31, 1898 (Bath), January 3, 1899 (S. Wales), February 2, 1900
  (London); it has also been observed several times in December. These
  facts and others connected with this species in Britain certainly lend
  colour to the oft-repeated statement that the moth hibernates in this
  country. The insect is known to enter houses, and to examine holes and
  cracks in walls, dry banks, etc., in the autumn. Mr. J. P. Barrett, in a
  note, written in November or December, 1900, states that six or seven
  moths came into his house at Margate in October, and that one was still
  hidden in his bedroom. However, if it be granted that the moth does
  hibernate here, the instances are so rare and isolated that, unless such
  specimens are impregnated females, the chances of these reproducing their
  kind the following year are not great. We have, therefore, to fall back
  upon immigration as the probable source of the Humming-Bird Hawk-moth in
  Britain. Except the more northern portion, this species is distributed
  over the whole of the Palæarctic region, including India, China, Corea,
  and Japan.</p>

<h5><b>The Broad-bordered Bee Hawk-moth</b> (<i>Hemaris
fuciformis</i>).</h5>

  <p>We have but two kinds of Bee Hawk-moths in our islands, and the
  present species (Plate <a href="#plate21">21</a>, Figs. 2, 3) is easily
  recognized by the broad reddish brown borders of the wings and especially
  those on the front pair, which also have a black bar at the end of the
  cell. When freshly emerged the wings are not clear and transparent, but
  covered with greenish-grey scales, which are so loosely attached that
  they are lost after the moth's first flight.</p>

  <p>The egg is bright green, and is laid on the underside of a leaf of
  honeysuckle. When very young the caterpillar is yellowish white, but when
  full grown (Plate <a href="#plate20">20</a>, Fig. 2) it is whitish green
  on the back, green on the sides, and reddish brown beneath. Along the
  middle of the back there is a darker, much interrupted, green line and a
  yellow line on each side of it; the spiracles are reddish, the head is
  dark green, and the horn reddish brown merging into violet at the base,
  and brown at the tip. Sometimes there are blotches of reddish brown on
  the sides. When quite mature and ready to assume the chrysalis stage the
  caterpillar changes in colour to purplish brown. At all times it is
  difficult to detect, as its colour and markings agree so well with the
  stems, stalks, and leaves of the food plant. If a leaf of honeysuckle
  having round holes on each side of the midrib be noticed, examination of
  the underside of that leaf may reveal a young caterpillar of this
  species. <!-- Page 54 --><span class="pagenum" title="086.png"><a
  name="page54"></a>{54}</span></p>

  <p>The common honeysuckle, or woodbine (<i>Lonicera periclymenum</i>) is
  the usual food, but in confinement the caterpillars will eat the foliage
  of the cultivated kinds of <i>Lonicera</i>, and, it is stated, even
  snowberry (<i>Symphoricarpus racemosus</i>). In rearing it will, however,
  be safer to supply them with the ordinary food wherever this is to be
  obtained. July and August are the months in which to look for them. The
  chrysalis is blackish brown, the skin is rather roughened, and the ring
  divisions are paler brown. It is protected by a silken cocoon, the
  interior of which is smooth, and the exterior coated with earth, etc.</p>

  <p>From mid-May to mid-June in average years, the moth is on the wing.
  The blossoms of the rhododendron are its favourite attraction, and the
  best time to see it at these flowers is on a nice sunny morning between
  ten o'clock and midday. The flowers of the bugle (<i>Ajuga reptans</i>)
  growing in meadows, wood-ridings, on railway banks or hedgerows, are
  hardly less attractive, but these are less easily worked than the higher
  shrubs. The collector has simply to stand before the latter and await the
  arrival of the active Bee Hawks. Among other flowers that this moth has
  been observed to visit are those of its own food plant; ragged robins
  (<i>Lychnis flos-cuculi</i>), ground ivy (<i>Nepeta glechoma</i>), and
  also blue-bell and primrose.</p>

  <p>The species is widely distributed and locally common throughout
  England, but its northern range does not extend apparently beyond
  Yorkshire. According to Kane it is absent from Ireland; and the reports
  of odd specimens from Scotland are probably erroneous. Its distribution
  abroad extends over Europe, except the most northern parts, a large
  portion of northern and central Asia, and southwards to North Africa.</p>

  <p>Moses Harris, it may be mentioned, figured this moth in 1775 as "The
  Clear-winged Humming-bird Sphinx." <!-- Page 55 --><span class="pagenum" title="087.png"
  ><a name="page55"></a>{55}</span></p>

<h5><b>The Narrow-bordered Bee Hawk-moth</b> (<i>Hemaris tityus</i>).</h5>

  <p>This moth (Plate <a href="#plate21">21</a>, Figs. 4, 5) has long been
  known as "<i>bombyliformis</i>" and was so mentioned by Haworth in 1802,
  but for some years past there has been a growing tendency to discard the
  name altogether, and as most recent authors follow Kirby's identification
  of this species as the <i>tityus</i> of Linnæus, that name is here
  adopted.</p>

  <p>The chief characters separating this moth from the preceding are the
  narrow blackish borders of the wings and the absence of the black mark at
  the end of the cell of fore wings. It has been suggested that the female
  deposits its green oval eggs on the undersides of the leaves of
  devil's-bit scabious (<i>Scabiosa succisa</i>) whilst on the wing, but as
  she will lay freely in a box it is most probable that she settles on the
  plants when engaged in egg laying.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar (Plate <a href="#plate20">20</a>, Fig. 1) is green,
  roughened with white points, from which tiny hairs arise; the green
  colour varies in tint from whitish to bluish; the lines along each side
  of the back are yellowish, and often have purplish red spots, or patches,
  upon them; the spiracles are set in purplish red patches, and the
  roughened reddish-brown horn is finely pointed. The under side is
  traversed by a purplish-red stripe. There is some modification in the
  reddish markings, both as regards number and intensity; these are well
  developed in the specimen from the New Forest figured on Plate <a
  href="#plate20">20</a>. The caterpillars may be found in June and July on
  the under sides of the lower leaves of the scabious, and as they eat
  holes in the leaves these marks should afford a clue to their
  whereabouts.</p>

  <p>A few days before changing to a dark brown chrysalis, which is
  enclosed in a coarse and very loosely constructed cocoon, the caterpillar
  assumes a reddish colour.</p>

  <p>This moth, which much resembles a large humble bee, is on <!-- Page 56
  --><span class="pagenum" title="088.png"><a
  name="page56"></a>{56}</span>the wing from about the middle of May to the
  middle of June. It should be looked for in places where its food plant
  flourishes, such as rough fields adjoining woods, woodland glades, marshy
  heaths, fens, bogs, etc. It visits the blossoms of various low growing
  plants, among which the louseworts (<i>Pedicularis palustris</i> and
  <i>P. sylvatica</i>) and the bugle (<i>Ajuga reptans</i>) are perhaps
  favourites. In some localities the blossoms of the rhododendron and of
  the bird's-foot trefoil (<i>Lotus corniculatus</i>) are very attractive.
  When seen hovering over the flowers it must be approached cautiously, as,
  although seemingly fully engrossed in the business in hand, it is quickly
  alarmed and its movements are rapid.</p>

  <p>It occurs throughout the greater part of England and Wales and
  northwards to Sutherlandshire in Scotland. In Ireland it is abundant in
  many localities.</p>

  <p>Distributed over Europe its range extends northwards to Lapland,
  southwards to north-west Africa, and eastward to Amurland.</p>

<h5><b>Prominents</b> (<i>Notodontidæ</i>).</h5>

  <p>In the majority of our moths belonging to this family there is a
  tooth-like tuft of scales projecting from about the middle of the inner
  margin of the fore wings; these, when the moth is resting, are brought
  together and raised above the level of the closed wings (see Fig. 11,
  page <a href="#page11">11</a>). The antennæ of the male are bipectinated
  in most of the species, but those of <i>Odontosia</i>,
  <i>Lophopteryx</i>, and <i>Phalera</i> are dentated and each tooth has a
  little tuft of short hair.</p>

  <p>The moths are not often seen in the day time, but a few species are
  sometimes met with at rest on tree trunks, palings, etc. All fly at night
  and are pretty rapid on the wing; possibly if it were not for the fact
  that a bright light has a powerful attraction for them, the perfect
  insects would be rarely captured. <!-- Page 57 --><span class="pagenum" title="089.png"
  ><a name="page57"></a>{57}</span>Specimens, when caught, except females
  which it may be well to keep for eggs, should be killed and pinned at
  once, as many kinds become very restless when imprisoned in a box and
  soon damage themselves. Females usually deposit their eggs freely, and in
  most cases the caterpillars are not difficult to rear when once they
  begin to feed. Sometimes it is not easy to induce them to commence this
  very necessary business. The caterpillars, except those of <i>Phalera</i>
  and <i>Pygæra</i>, are without hairs on the body; those of the true
  Prominents generally have one, or more, hump on the back; in some kinds
  the anal prolegs or hind claspers, are small. When resting the hinder
  part of the caterpillar is more or less raised, several of them elevate
  the front portion also, and frequently the posture assumed is a most
  curious one.</p>

  <p>The caterpillars of <i>Cerura</i>, <i>Dicranura</i>, and
  <i>Stauropus</i> have the hind claspers transformed into tail-like
  appendages, which in the case of the Puss and Kittens take the form of a
  pair of slender tubes furnished with flagellæ, or whips, which can be
  protruded or withdrawn as occasion may require. These organs are
  presumably for defensive purposes, but are not always effective in
  combating the attack of parasitical flies, as these evidently manage to
  deposit their egg on the caterpillars not infrequently.</p>

  <p>The pupa, or chrysalis, of some kinds is enclosed in a hard cocoon on
  tree trunks, and others in a soft cocoon generally underground;
  sometimes, however, the cocoon is spun up between leaves; occasionally,
  as for example that of the Buff-tip, the chrysalis is found in the ground
  without any protecting covering, although the cell in which it was formed
  may have been flimsily lined with silk.</p>

  <p>Nearly one hundred species are referred to this family in Staudinger's
  "Catalogue of Palæarctic Lepidoptera," and of these twenty-five occur, or
  have been taken, in the British Isles, nearly all of which are accepted
  as indigenous. Two of the <!-- Page 58 --><span class="pagenum" title="090.png"
  ><a name="page58"></a>{58}</span>three species not generally regarded as
  true natives have been found in the caterpillar state, and the third was
  reared from an egg obtained with others of the same kind in Norfolk.</p>

<h5><b>The Alder Kitten</b> (<i>Cerura bicuspis</i>).</h5>

  <p>This moth (Plate <a href="#plate22">22</a>, Fig. 3) differs from
  either of the two next following in being whiter, and in having both
  margins of the central band of the fore wings angled or bent inwards
  above the middle; this is markedly so on the outer side. The band itself
  is black, inclining to purplish rather than grey. Barrett mentions a
  specimen without central band or cloud towards tip.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:33%;">
      <a href="images/fig19.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig19.jpg"
      alt="Fig. 19." title="Fig. 19." /></a>
    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig. 19.</span> <b>Cocoon
    of the Alder Kitten.</b></p>
  </div>

  <p>According to Buckler, the caterpillar is yellow-green; head dark
  reddish-brown; at the back of the head commences a broad, reddish-brown
  blotch, which runs to a point on the back of the third segment, where is
  a slight elevation; on the fourth it recommences and becomes broader on
  each segment to the eighth, where it extends below and encloses the
  spiracles, thence it narrows to the tenth, continuing on the eleventh and
  twelfth as a broad stripe, and <!-- Page 59 --><span class="pagenum" title="091.png"
  ><a name="page59"></a>{59}</span>widening on the thirteenth, where it
  again narrows to the tentacles; in the broad portion of this dorsal
  marking are faint indications of two or three orange spots; on each side
  it is broadly edged with pale yellow, and on the sixth, seventh, and
  eighth segments its margin is deeply indented. It feeds on alder and
  birch in July and August.</p>

  <p>The cocoon is shown in its natural position on birch bark (Fig. 19).
  This was kindly lent to me for figuring by Mr. L. W. Newman, of Bexley,
  who also had another in which lichen as well as fragments of bark were
  worked into the surface, so that the cocoon was less in evidence than the
  one portrayed.</p>

  <p>The moth emerges in May and June.</p>

  <p>The first British specimen, a male, was found on alder near Preston,
  and was recorded by Doubleday in the <i>Zoologist</i> for 1847. A second
  example was noted from the same locality in 1849. This district in
  Lancashire, and Tilgate Forest in Sussex, are the chief homes in the
  north and the south of England respectively; but one or more specimens
  have occurred in Cheshire, Herefordshire, Oxfordshire, Norfolk, Suffolk,
  and Devonshire, and more frequently in Staffordshire, Derbyshire, and
  Yorkshire. It does not seem to inhabit Scotland or Ireland, neither has
  it been recorded from Wales, so far as I can find, more than once.</p>

  <p>The species is found in Germany, Switzerland, Eastern France, Belgium,
  Southern Sweden, Central Russia, Livonia, Finland, Ussuri, and a local
  race occurs in Amurland.</p>

<h5><b>The Poplar Kitten</b> (<i>Cerura bifida</i>).</h5>

  <p>Fore wings grey, with a broad, dark grey central band, and a cloud of
  the same colour towards the tips of the wings; the band is inwardly
  margined by an almost straight black line, and outwardly by a curved
  line; the third line is double, and curved towards the costa, forming the
  inner edge of the grey cloud, the lower part is wavy. The first black
  line is inwardly, and <!-- Page 60 --><span class="pagenum" title="092.png"
  ><a name="page60"></a>{60}</span>the second outwardly edged with
  ochreous, and preceding the first is a series of black dots.</p>

  <p>The full-grown caterpillar, which is green, with a yellow-edged,
  purplish, irregular stripe on the back, is figured on Plate <a
  href="#plate23">23</a>, together with a very young example, the
  purplish-black eggs as laid, and the red-brown chrysalis. The cocoon from
  which the chrysalis was extracted was spun up on a fairly stout twig of
  poplar, from which some of the bark had been torn; the cocoon was formed,
  as regards the upper part, on the bare twig, and this was covered with
  gnawed wood, instead of with bark fragments, as is the lower end. The
  moth is figured on Plate <a href="#plate22">22</a>, and the early stages
  on Plate <a href="#plate23">23</a>.</p>

  <p>The moth emerges in June, sometimes in July, and may occasionally be
  found at rest on the trunks of poplars, on which the caterpillar feeds
  from July to September; also on adjacent walls or palings. The cocoons
  are made up on the surface or in the chinks of the bark, and may be
  searched for, all through the winter and early spring. It is curious to
  note how readily these are detected after the moth has escaped, and how
  difficult they are to see before that event. Usually there is but one
  brood in the year, but in the hot summer of 1906 a male specimen emerged
  from a few chrysalids that I had reared from eggs laid at the end of June
  of that year. On the other hand, the moth has been known to remain in the
  chrysalis for two winters.</p>

  <p>The species is not uncommon in some parts of the London district, and
  seems to occur throughout England wherever poplars abound. It does not
  appear to have been found in Scotland, and is scarce in Ireland. Abroad
  it is found in Central Europe with a northern range to Finland,
  southwards to Italy and Greece, and eastwards to the Altai.</p>

<h5><b>The Sallow Kitten</b> (<i>Cerura furcula</i>).</h5>

  <p>This moth differs from the last in its generally smaller size, but
  more especially in the shape of the black line forming the outer margin
  of the central band; this is always more or less angled or dentate
  towards the front margin of the wings, whereas, in the Poplar Kitten,
  this portion of the line forms a clean curve (Plate <a
  href="#plate22">22</a>, Figs. 4, 5).</p>

  <p>The eggs are black, rather glossy, and are generally deposited in
  pairs, but rarely more than three, and often only singly, on the upper
  surface of a leaf of sallow or willow. The caterpillar feeds from July to
  September, sometimes as early as the end of June, or as late as October.
  It is green, with a yellow tinge; the markings on the back are similar to
  these characters in the caterpillar of the preceding species, but, as
  will be seen by looking at the figures on Plate <a
  href="#plate23">23</a>, they are not quite the same in outline. The
  figure of the young caterpillar on this plate was made soon after it left
  the egg, and the shell from which it emerged is also depicted. Sallow and
  willow are the usual food plants, but in August, 1906, I found a
  half-grown caterpillar of this species on aspen, but it died a few days
  afterwards. The reddish-brown chrysalis is enclosed in the usual hard
  cocoon of its kind, which is affixed to a branch or the trunk of the tree
  upon which the caterpillar fed. A depression is usually selected, and
  when the cocoon is finished off with its covering of bark fragments it is
  difficult to see.</p>

  <p>The species is well distributed over England, Ireland, and Scotland;
  perhaps more frequently obtained on the mosses of Cheshire, Lancashire,
  and Yorkshire, than in other parts of England. It is found in Central and
  Northern Europe, and, according to Staudinger, in Amurland and North
  America. <!-- Page 62 --><span class="pagenum" title="096.png"><a
  name="page62"></a>{62}</span></p>

<h5><b>The Puss Moth</b> (<i>Dicranura vinula</i>).</h5>

  <p>Portraits of both sexes of this rather common moth are given on Plate
  <a href="#plate24">24</a>. The head, thorax, and body are very fluffy.
  The whitish fore wings are crossed by several wave-like lines; the main
  veins (<i>nervures</i>) are ochreous, and the branches (<i>nervules</i>)
  are blackish; beyond the more or less clear basal area there is often a
  broad but irregular blackish band, and the wavy markings on the outer
  area vary in intensity (sometimes the short streaks between the veins
  terminate on the outer margin in black dots). Hind wings whitish in the
  male, and suffused with blackish in the female, to a greater or lesser
  extent. In some examples of the female the fore wings and the body are
  also tinged with blackish. The antennæ are bipectinated in both sexes,
  but those of the female have the teeth much shorter than those of the
  male.</p>

  <p>The eggs are usually laid in pairs on the upper surface of a leaf of
  sallow, willow, or poplar. In colour these are purplish or reddish brown,
  shining, and finely grained; a minute depression at the top is yellowish,
  with a black speck at the bottom of the hollow.</p>

  <p>In its last stage the caterpillar is green, with a white or
  yellowish-edged purplish brown band on the back; the head is light brown
  margined with black and purplish behind, and the ring immediately
  following (first thoracic) is green margined with yellow and having two
  black spots on the upper part. When the creature assumes the position
  which Professor Poulton terms the terrifying attitude, the front part is
  elevated, the head is drawn back into the ring next to it, and the tails
  are raised and curved forward over the back (see Plate <a
  href="#plate25">25</a>). Seen thus from the front the appearance of the
  caterpillar is certainly grotesque, and no doubt affords it some
  protection from its enemies. It feeds on poplars, sallows, and willows,
  usually in July and August, but sometimes as late as September. <!-- Page
  63 --><span class="pagenum" title="097.png"><a

  <div class="figright" style="width:26%;">

    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig. 20.</span></p>

    <p style="text-align:center"><b>Caterpillar of Puss Moth.</b></p>
  </div>

  <p>The reddish brown chrysalis is enclosed in a hard cocoon spun up and
  securely attached to the trunk or under a limb of the tree upon which the
  caterpillar was nourished, or upon some other adjacent thereto. I once
  found a cocoon on the lower rail of a garden fence. In constructing the
  cocoon fragments of bark and wood are worked on the exterior, but failing
  these the caterpillar will make use of any available material for the
  purpose. If enclosed in a tumbler covered with glass it will spin a
  transparent cocoon. Emergence from its strong pupal chamber would appear
  to be a difficult matter, but the caterpillar and the chrysalis both
  contribute something towards assisting the final efforts of the moth to
  escape. The caterpillar, in constructing the cocoon, is careful to make
  the exit end with a thinner layer than the other parts; then the
  chrysalis is provided with a cutting implement in the shape of a
  keel-like arrangement on the fore part, and with this it operates at the
  right time on the weak end until a breach is made; the moth breaks the
  head end of the chrysalis case and moistens <!-- Page 64 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="098.png"><a name="page64"></a>{64}</span>the
  ruptured material with a softening fluid so that the insect is able to
  force its way out of the cocoon; the chrysalis case remains in the
  cocoon.</p>

  <p>The moth is on the wing in May and June, and sometimes July. Three
  specimens that I reared this year (1907) from eggs found on a leaf of
  poplar last year, emerged on June 4th, 10th, and July 12th. They all
  pupated about the same time, and side by side on cork bark.</p>

  <p>I believe this species has not been recorded from the Orkneys or the
  Shetlands, but with these exceptions it seems to occur in more or less
  frequency throughout the United Kingdom. It is widely distributed in
  Europe, and its range extends to Siberia. In Lapland, Amurland, Japan,
  and North Africa it is represented by named forms.</p>

<h5><b>The Lobster</b> (<i>Stauropus fagi</i>).</h5>

  <p>The English name of this insect does not apply to the greyish brown or
  sometimes blackish moth (Plate <a href="#plate26">26</a>), but to its
  remarkable caterpillar, the figures of which, on Plate <a
  href="#plate27">27</a>, are reproduced from drawings by Mr. Alfred Sich.
  In colour this curious-shaped creature is always some shade of brown, the
  head is marked in front with reddish, the ring divisions of the body are
  darker brown, and the hind rings are reddish brown.</p>

  <p>The late Mr. W. H. Tugwell, referring to the early history of these
  caterpillars, states that a female of the blackish form received from
  Reading in May was kept alive for seven days, during which time she laid
  a few eggs on oak leaves each night; "all told" she produced forty eggs.
  As she was then quite exhausted, a good many had probably been laid
  previously. The eggs when first laid are of a pale cream colour,
  hemispherical in shape and flattened beneath. About the seventh day a
  circular depression, and a dark spot, appear, and gradually the entire
  egg assumes a dull purplish colour. "On the tenth day the caterpillars
  hatch out. When they first leave the shell they appear extremely large,
  this is partly on account of the long legs and the caudal appendages
  which are ever nervously twisting about. The young caterpillars most
  carefully keep guard over their own egg-shell, which is to them an
  all-important item, as this provides them with their first meal&mdash;the
  first and only food they take for seven days, in fact, for a longer
  period, as it is not until after moulting their first skin that they eat
  any other food. This fact I proved over and over again, as, being an
  invalid, my time was quite free to watch them hour after hour and day
  after day. As soon as they have eaten their way out of the shell they
  stretch themselves, and then from time to time nibble portions of the
  white chitinous-looking egg-shell, and a tough morsel it seems to be for
  them; but they never leave it for more than an inch or so, and then
  rapidly come back. They keep nervously moving around and about this, and
  if perchance another caterpillar should approach within touch of it, a
  vigorous attack is made to drive off the intruder. All going well during
  the first hour or two, the whole of the shell, or sometimes not more than
  from half to two-thirds of it is consumed; and once the caterpillars
  really leave the egg-shell, that is, walk away from it, they do not touch
  it after. If by any chance a young caterpillar gets driven away from the
  egg-shell, death is certain to result, as I could never induce them to
  feed on portions of empty shells left by others; nor would they eat the
  leaves or the brown stipules of the beech, which it has been suggested
  they do eat. In no single instance did they eat other food in their first
  skin save and alone the one meal of their own egg-shells."</p>

<p><!-- Page 65 --><span class="pagenum" title="101.png"><a name="page65"></a>{65}</span></p>

  <p>The caterpillars feed on beech, and also occasionally on birch, oak,
  hazel, and some fruit trees, and may be found from July to September.</p>

  <p>The chrysalis, which is enclosed in a tightly woven cocoon <!-- Page
  66 --><span class="pagenum" title="102.png"><a
  name="page66"></a>{66}</span>spun up between leaves, usually dead ones,
  is blackish brown with a violet bloom upon it.</p>

  <p>The moths are on the wing in May and June in an early season, but not
  until June and July in a backward one. They may be sometimes found
  resting by day on the stems of small trees or even bushes. "In fact,
  anything," Mr. Holland says, "which stands upright in a beech wood will
  do, so that it is not too large." The blackish form of the moth is so
  like a knot on a stem that it is easily overlooked. There is sometimes a
  second emergence in August. Possibly those caterpillars found during the
  latter part of September in some favourable years are from eggs deposited
  by moths emerging in early August, and the offspring of May parents.</p>

  <p>The species is widely distributed, but not often common, over the
  Midland, Southern, and Eastern Counties of England. It seems to flourish
  chiefly in beech woods, and is perhaps more frequent in parts of
  Berkshire, Bucks, and Oxfordshire, than elsewhere, but it is not uncommon
  in some seasons in the New Forest. It has been reported from Swansea in
  Wales, and once from Selby, Yorkshire. In Ireland it is exceedingly rare,
  and is not known to occur in Scotland. The range abroad extends through
  Central Europe, northward to Sweden, southward to Spain and Portugal, and
  eastward to Armenia, Ussuri, and Japan.</p>

<h5><b>The Dusky Marbled Brown</b> (<i>Gluphisia crenata</i>).</h5>

  <p>Only three authenticated British examples are known of this dingy
  grey-brown moth (Plate <a href="#plate28">28</a>, Fig. 3). The earliest
  intimation we have of the occurrence of this species in England is the
  following record by the late Mr. Henry Doubleday in the
  <i>Entomologist</i>, vol. i. p. 156: "<i>Chaonia crenata.</i> The first
  British specimen of this insect was taken in Ongar Park Wood, in June,
  1839; a second in the same place, in June of the present year. Both
  specimens were females." The locality mentioned in the foregoing notice
  which was penned July 10th, 1841, is in the County of Essex. At a meeting
  of the Entomological Society of London held in April, 1854, the Rev.
  Joseph Greene exhibited a specimen that he had reared from a caterpillar
  obtained from a poplar near Halton, in Bucks, August, 1853.</p>

  <p>According to Buckler the caterpillar is pale green, with a thin
  whitish line down the middle of the back, a broader yellow line on each
  side, and some reddish spots on the front and hind rings of the body; the
  spiracles are black. It spins a somewhat oval-shaped cocoon between two
  poplar leaves, and therein turns to a glossy blackish brown
  chrysalis.</p>

  <p>Abroad the species is found in Central Europe, North Italy,
  North-western Russia, Southern Norway, and also in Amurland and Ussuri.
  There are said to be two broods on the continent, one emergence of moths
  taking place in April and the other in June or July.</p>

<h5><b>The Marbled Brown</b> (<i>Drymonia trimacula</i>).</h5>

  <p>Somewhat similar to the next species, but the fore wings are generally
  whiter; the cross lines are not so straight, and there is no black
  crescent above the centre of the wings (Plate <a href="#plate28">28</a>,
  Fig. 1).</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is green, with two yellow lines on the back, and a
  yellow one along the spiracles, the latter edged above with reddish. It
  feeds on oak, and may be found from July to September; stated to hide by
  day in the chinks of the bark. The reddish brown chrysalis is enclosed in
  a cocoon of earth held together with silk. It may be searched for at the
  roots of grass, etc., around the foot of oak trees growing in parks or in
  the more open parts of woods. The moth appears in May.</p>

  <p>Although nowhere really common, it seems to occur pretty generally
  over the southern portion of England, and as far north <!-- Page 68
  --><span class="pagenum" title="106.png"><a
  name="page68"></a>{68}</span>as Derbyshire and Staffordshire. Farther
  north, and in Wales and Scotland, it has been rarely met with. Recorded
  by Birchall to be not uncommon at Killarney; but Kane states that he has
  never seen an Irish specimen.</p>

  <p>The species occurs locally throughout Central Europe, also in
  Transylvania, Northern and Central Italy, and Eastern Armenia. In Ussuri,
  and Japan, it is represented by the form <i>dodonides</i>, Staud.</p>

<h5><b>The Lunar Marbled Brown</b> (<i>Drymonia chaonia</i>).</h5>

  <p>The fore wings of this moth (Plate <a href="#plate28">28</a>, Fig. 2)
  are dark fuscous, almost blackish, a short white line near the base; the
  central third is white clouded with the ground colour and limited by
  white edged black wavy lines; a black crescent just above the centre of
  the wing. Hind wings smoky grey with a pale curved line. The egg, which
  is bluish white in colour, is of the usual Notodont shape. Caterpillar
  green, merging into bluish-green on the back; the lines are pale yellow,
  or creamy white, that along the black margined spiracles is rather broad
  and is sometimes tinged with reddish on the three front rings. Head
  green, mouth marked with pale yellow. Feeds in June, July, and August on
  oak. From about a dozen eggs that I had in May, 1907, the caterpillars
  hatched on the 13th of the month. Only one got through safely to the
  chrysalis stage which it reached at the end of June. On June 26th some
  half-grown and smaller caterpillars were received from the New Forest,
  only one of these was seen on July 19th, but it was then nearly full
  grown and appeared to be quite healthy, and others had pupated or
  died.</p>

  <p>The chrysalis is deep red brown, enclosed in a silken cocoon covered
  with particles of earth; generally found at the roots of isolated oak
  trees (Plate <a href="#plate29">29</a>, Figs. 1, 1<i>a</i>).</p>

  <p>The moth emerges in May, sometimes at the end of April, generally in
  the afternoon; it sits on the tree trunk to expand and dry its wings, and
  then ascends higher up the tree. It is found in Berkshire,
  Buckinghamshire, and in most of the southern counties of England, and in
  the west, but it seems to be rarer eastward and northward, and also in
  Scotland. In Ireland it has been found, very sparingly, in Wicklow and
  Kerry, and "numbers were taken in a moth trap at Clonbrook."</p>

  <p>The range abroad is very similar to that of the next species.</p>

<h5><b>The Swallow Prominent</b> (<i>Pheosia tremula</i>).</h5>

  <p>Normally whitish, with a brown shaded black stripe along the inner
  margin of the fore wings, and a brownish cloud, with black streaks in it,
  towards the tips of these wings; the outer extremities of the veins are
  white, there is a white wedge-shaped streak between veins 1 and 2, and
  from the apex of this an indented white line runs to the base of the
  wing. Sometimes the whole discal area is suffused with brownish. The moth
  is shown on Plate <a href="#plate28">28</a>, Figs. 4, 5, and the early
  stages on Plate <a href="#plate29">29</a>, Figs. 2, 2<i>a</i>, and
  2<i>b</i>. The egg when laid is creamy white, and the newly hatched
  caterpillar is pale green. When full grown the caterpillar is green with
  rather darker, but not always clearly defined, lines along the back, and
  a yellow line along the region of the black spiracles; the underside is
  sometimes reddish. Another form is brownish in colour and the yellow line
  is then generally obscure. The green form is figured on Plate <a
  href="#plate29">29</a>. The usual food is poplar, but sallow is also
  eaten. It may be found in late June and early July and again in September
  and October. The chrysalis is reddish brown and glossy except on the wing
  covers, which are granulated and appear darker. The cocoon is roughly
  constructed of silk and earth, and before spinning it the autumnal
  caterpillar sometimes burrows a good depth under the surface of the soil;
  the summer cocoons are said to be made up among leaves. The moth is on
  the wing in May and August. <!-- Page 70 --><span class="pagenum" title="110.png"
  ><a name="page70"></a>{70}</span></p>

  <p>The species is perhaps most common in the southern and eastern
  counties of England, but seems to be pretty generally distributed
  throughout the country, and extends into Scotland as far as Moray. In
  Ireland it has a wide range but is only common near Londonderry. Abroad
  it is found in Central and Northern Europe, and as far east as Amurland
  and Ussuri. In America it is represented by <i>P. dimidiata</i>, H.-S.,
  which does not seem to be really specifically distinct.</p>

<h5><b>The Lesser Swallow Prominent</b> (<i>Pheosia dictæoides</i>).</h5>

  <p>Very similar to the last species, but generally smaller, and the
  ground colour has usually less brown in it; the chief character, however,
  by which it may be distinguished, is the broader and clearer white
  wedge-shaped mark between veins one and two on the fore wings. Reference
  to the figures of each species on Plate <a href="#plate28">28</a> will
  show this at once.</p>

  <p>The eggs are greenish white, and the full-grown caterpillar is
  purplish brown on the back merging into violet on the sides; there is a
  broad yellow stripe along the spiracle area; the head is violet, faintly
  marked with black. A noticeable feature of this caterpillar is its
  varnished appearance. It feeds on birch in June and July, and sometimes
  in September and October. The early stages are figured on Plate <a
  href="#plate29">29</a>, Figs. 3, 3<i>a</i>, and 3<i>b</i>.</p>

  <p>The species has a somewhat similar distribution to that mentioned for
  the preceding, but it seems to be commoner in the North of England and in
  Scotland than elsewhere in the British Isles.</p>

<h5><b>The Pebble Prominent</b> (<i>Notodonta ziczac</i>).</h5>

  <p>This moth varies in the colour of the fore wings from pale ochreous
  brown to a darker brown tinged with reddish; the usual pale greyish patch
  in the middle of the costal area is <!-- Page 71 --><span class="pagenum" title="111.png"
  ><a name="page71"></a>{71}</span>sometimes obliterated by a suffusion of
  the darker colour; the dark-brown first and second lines are often only
  visible towards the front edge of the wings; a blackish lunule or
  crescent forms, in conjunction with the strongly curved outer line, the
  outline of the characteristic pebble-like mark on the apical area of the
  wings; a pale saw-edged line, which is inwardly shaded with dusky and
  intersected by black streaks on the veins, traverses the pebble mark, but
  in the lighter coloured specimens this line is not traceable. The female
  has browner hind wings than the male. The moth is depicted on Plate <a
  href="#plate31">31</a>, Fig. 2; and the early stages on Plate <a
  href="#plate30">30</a>, Figs. 1, 1<i>a</i>, and 1<i>b</i>.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar, when full grown, is pale ochreous grey, sometimes
  tinged with pink or purplish brown, or with yellowish, and especially on
  the hind rings; a yellow stripe along the back is edged here and there
  with brownish; the diffuse dusky line along the area of the black
  margined spiracles is edged with yellowish. It is occasionally found on
  poplar, but sallows and willow are the more usual food plants, and it
  feeds upon these in June and July and again in August and September. The
  reddish brown chrysalis is enclosed in an earthen cocoon just under the
  surface of the ground at the roots of tree or bush upon which the
  caterpillar fed. The moth emerges in May and June from chrysalides of the
  previous year, and in August as a second generation. Three broods in the
  year have been obtained in confinement, but this is probably
  exceptional.</p>

  <p>Widely distributed throughout the British Isles, but seems to have a
  preference for fens and marshy ground. It occurs all over Central and
  Northern Europe, its range extends through France to Spain, Italy, and
  Corsica, and it has been recorded from Armenia and Amurland. <!-- Page 72
  --><span class="pagenum" title="112.png"><a
  name="page72"></a>{72}</span></p>

<h5><b>The Iron Prominent</b> (<i>Notodonta dromedarius</i>).</h5>

  <p>The specimen shown on Plate <a href="#plate31">31</a> is from Surrey,
  and represents the form most frequently obtained in the south of England.
  Northwards the species becomes darker in colour, and the reddish and
  yellow marking much reduced. The form <i>perfusca</i>, as figured by
  Stephens, has the fore wings dark purplish grey, streaked with dark
  brown; a pale patch at the base is russet marked, the line before the
  middle of the wing is russet, and a dash of the same colour lies at the
  lower extremity of the line beyond the middle; the hind wings are
  brownish grey with a broad whitish cross line. The specimen, which is of
  the female sex, was from Dublin, and the form was not then supposed to
  occur in any other part of the British Isles. It is now, however, well
  known in Scotland and the North of England, and also in Ireland. Some
  examples that I have seen from Scotland are much larger and darker than
  the figure referred to. In his description of this form Stephens states
  that the fore wings are fuscous mixed with chestnut, with darker clouds.
  The caterpillar, which is figured on Plate <a href="#plate30">30</a>, is
  green, becoming yellowish on the back; a rather broad stripe on the back
  of the front rings and the markings on the humps and on other parts of
  the body are purplish brown. It feeds on birch, alder, and sometimes
  hazel, usually on the former, in June, July, and August. In some seasons,
  and localities, the moth appears twice in the year: the caterpillar may
  then be found in September and October. The chrysalis is blackish-brown
  and rather glossy, enclosed in a cocoon composed of silk and sand or
  other soil, and may be obtained by lightly digging up the earth and sods
  at the roots of trees.</p>

<h5><b>The Three Humped</b> (<i>Notodonta ph&oelig;be</i> = <i>tritophus</i>).</h5>

  <p>Very little is known in Britain of this Central European moth (Plate
  <a href="#plate31">31</a>, Fig. 3). The first specimen of which we have
  any <!-- Page 73 --><span class="pagenum" title="113.png"><a
  name="page73"></a>{73}</span>knowledge was reared on August 10, 1842 from
  a caterpillar found in Essex on aspen. This example was included, with
  two others, one of which was captured in Suffolk, in the collection of
  the late Dr. Mason, which was dispersed at Stevens' Auction Rooms in
  March, 1905.</p>

  <p>Besides the specimens mentioned above, a caterpillar, which
  subsequently died, was beaten from alder in the Exeter district in 1870;
  another was obtained from hazel in Gloucestershire, but this was
  "ichneumoned." Then there is a record of a moth or caterpillar,
  presumably the former, occurring in the neighbourhood of Paisley; and
  there is a report that a caterpillar was once found at the base of an
  aspen growing on Clapham Common. A specimen was taken at electric light
  at Bedford, May, 1907.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is green, with three reddish humps on the back, and an
  interrupted reddish line along the sides. It feeds on poplar in July and
  August.</p>

<h5><b>The Large Dark Prominent</b> (<i>Notodonta tritophus</i> = <i>torva</i>).</h5>

  <p>Another Central European species, of which only one specimen is known
  to have occurred in Britain. This was reared from an egg, or from a
  caterpillar, obtained in Norfolk in the latter part of the summer of
  1882. The moth might be mistaken for a small dark coloured specimen of
  the next species (<i>N. trepida</i>), but the dark hindwings readily
  distinguish it (Plate <a href="#plate31">31</a>, Fig. 4).</p>

  <p>The caterpillar, although darker, bears considerable resemblance to
  that of the Pebble Prominent; it feeds in June and July, and also in
  September, on aspen.</p>

  <p>According to Staudinger this species is the <i>tritophus</i> of Esper,
  an earlier name than <i>torva</i>, Hübn.; whilst the preceding species,
  that has so long been referred to <i>tritophus</i>, Fabricius (or
  <i>trilophus</i>), is found to be <i>ph&oelig;be</i>, Siebert, which name
  has seventeen years' priority. <!-- Page 74 --><span class="pagenum" title="114.png"
  ><a name="page74"></a>{74}</span></p>

<h5><b>The Great Prominent</b> (<i>Notodonta trepida</i>).</h5>

  <p>Fore wings greyish, or ochreous grey, with dark cross lines; a
  blackish tuft from middle of inner margin, and a series of dark, or
  sometimes reddish, spots on a pale cross line before the inner margin.
  Hind wings whitish, sometimes ochreous tinged; clouded with greyish on
  costal area (Plate <a href="#plate31">31</a>, Fig. 5). When full grown
  the caterpillar is rather larger than the one figured on Plate <a
  href="#plate30">30</a>. In colour it is green, with yellow lines along
  the back, seven reddish-edged yellow oblique streaks on the sides, and a
  reddish tinged stripe on the two rings nearest the head. It is stated to
  assume a purplish tint when quite mature. May be found from end of June
  to early August on oak. The dark reddish brown chrysalis, which is
  enclosed in an earth-covered cocoon, may be found at the roots of oak
  trees in the autumn or winter.</p>

  <p>The moth emerges between late April and early June, sometimes
  remaining in the chrysalis for two winters. Light attracts it freely, and
  it is frequently seen in the illuminated moth trap, and may be
  occasionally noted on the iron frame of a gas lamp in suitable places.
  Sometimes the moth is met with in the daytime, resting on the trunks or
  branches of oak trees in woods, or on palings adjacent thereto. When such
  specimens happen to be females, they should be kept for eggs, which they
  lay freely.</p>

  <p>It occurs in most of the southern counties of England, is somewhat
  rare in the Midlands, and scarce in the northern counties and in
  Scotland. Recorded by Birchall as "not uncommon in Co. Wicklow," but Kane
  ("Cat. Lep. Ireland") states that he has no information concerning its
  occurrence in the sister island. Distributed throughout Central Europe,
  extending into Spain, Italy, and Corsica; also to South-east Russia,
  Armenia, and possibly Ussuri. <!-- Page 75 --><span class="pagenum" title="115.png"
  ><a name="page75"></a>{75}</span></p>

<h5><b>The White Prominent</b> (<i>Leucodonta bicoloria</i>).</h5>

  <p>The glossy white moth, prettily marked with orange and black, shown on
  Plate <a href="#plate33">33</a>, was not known to inhabit the British
  Isles until 1858 when Bonchard obtained one specimen in a large birch
  wood in the Killarney district, Ireland; in the following year he took a
  second specimen. Both captures were made in the month of June. In June,
  1861, one example of the moth was found in Burnt Wood, Staffordshire; and
  in the same wood, June, 1865, no fewer than six specimens were secured,
  and eggs obtained from one of the females. The caterpillars duly hatched
  out, but most of them were lost, only seven attaining the moth state.
  Kane states that in 1866 a specimen was taken in Mucross demesne, and
  caterpillars "were said also to have been beaten." Miss Vernon of
  Clontarf showed him her collection of insects from Kerry, and he found
  therein two rather poor specimens of the White Prominent from a new
  locality in Kerry. Barrett mentions the capture, in 1880, of a specimen
  near Exeter, Devonshire. From the foregoing, which comprises all that
  appears to be definitely known about British <i>L. bicoloria</i>, it will
  be gathered that the species is not only very local, but exceedingly
  rare.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar, figured on Plate <a href="#plate32">32</a>, from a
  coloured drawing by Mr. A. Sich, is pale yellowish green, rather whiter
  on the upper surface; the lines are green, the central one darkest; the
  stripe along the spiracles is yellow edged with green. It feeds on birch
  in July; and changes in due course to a dark reddish brown chrysalis,
  which is enclosed in a compact silken cocoon spun up between leaves. The
  moth emerges in May or June. Abroad the species seems to be generally
  distributed in Central Europe, and is also found in the Ural, Amurland,
  Ussuri, and Japan. <!-- Page 76 --><span class="pagenum" title="116.png"
  ><a name="page76"></a>{76}</span></p>

<h5><b>The Maple Prominent</b> (<i>Lophopteryx cuculla</i>).</h5>

  <p>To Donovan and the entomologists of his time this moth (Plate <a
  href="#plate33">33</a>, Fig. 4) was known by the English name still in
  use, Stephens considered it a rare insect, and remarks that he once
  caught a specimen at Darenth Wood, by "mothing," in June, 1820; several
  other examples had been taken in the same place, and in the neighbouring
  woods. Although many more localities are now known for the moth, it still
  continues to be rather a scarce species. It appears to inhabit woods on a
  chalky soil almost exclusively, and is found less uncommonly in the woods
  of Buckinghamshire than in its other haunts in Berkshire, Oxfordshire,
  Kent, Sussex, Devonshire, Essex, Cambridgeshire, Suffolk, and Norfolk.
  The bulk of the specimens in collections were probably reared from the
  egg, or from caterpillars obtained by beating or searching the maple
  bushes growing in the woods frequented by the moth.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is whitish green, rather glossy, with a dark green
  line along the middle of the back, which is broadest on the front rings,
  and a pale yellow stripe on the sides, the latter edged above with pale
  green; spiracles pinkish edged with black; a hump on the eleventh ring is
  purplish tinted. Head pale ochreous brown marked with reddish brown.
  Sometimes the general colour is yellowish or pinkish ochreous. May be
  found in June and July on maple (<i>Acer campestris</i>) and in
  confinement will feed very well on sycamore (<i>A. pseudoplatanus</i>).
  The moth usually emerges in May or June, but in 1901 Mr. Adkin reared ten
  moths, July 24 to 31, from eggs deposited in the spring of that year. The
  species does not seem to be a common one even abroad; its range extends
  through Central Europe to Italy and Sicily, and it is also found in
  Ussuri.</p>

<h5><b>The Coxcomb Prominent</b> (<i>Lophopteryx camelina</i>).</h5>

  <p>Probably the commonest of the true Prominents, and certainly the most
  variable. The early stages are figured on Plate <a
  href="#plate32">32</a>, and two forms of the moth on Plate <a
  href="#plate33">33</a>. In its typical and southern form the fore wings
  are more or less pale reddish brown with a darker cloud on the inner
  marginal area; there are three dusky, or blackish, cross lines, but two
  of these are generally very indistinct, the third runs from the blackish
  "tooth" on the inner margin to the front edge of the wing, and is
  followed by a pale wavy band often outwardly bordered with dusky.
  Sometimes the fore wings are clouded with dark brown, and in the North of
  England a dark reddish form occurs. In Scotland the fore wings vary in
  colour from dusky brown through reddish to pale yellowish brown;
  sometimes the "tooth" is reddish in chestnut coloured specimens. The
  whitish eggs are laid on the undersides of the leaves of various trees
  and bushes upon which the caterpillar feeds; these are chiefly birch,
  oak, hazel, sallow, and beech.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar, which appears in July to October, and sometimes even
  later, is green, with a darker line on the back, and a yellow one on the
  sides; two reddish tipped wart-like projections on the back of ring
  eleven. Occasionally the general colour is ochreous with a pinkish tinge,
  or it may be even purplish. There are two broods in the south of England,
  but only one in the north. The moths of the first brood fly in May and
  June, and those of the second in July and August, sometimes rather later.
  Pretty generally distributed throughout England and Wales, Ireland and
  Scotland. Abroad its range extends over Northern and Central Europe to
  Northern Spain, Northern and Central Italy, Dalmatia, Turkey, Armenia,
  Siberia, Amurland, Corea, and Japan. <!-- Page 78 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="120.png"><a name="page78"></a>{78}</span></p>

<h5><b>The Scarce Prominent</b> (<i>Odontosia carmelita</i>).</h5>

  <p>In 1828, when Stephens figured this moth, he only knew of two British
  specimens, both of which had been reared about sixteen years previously
  from caterpillars found at Darenth Wood. The wings, which are not thickly
  scaled, are purplish grey, becoming reddish brown on the front margins of
  the fore wings; the outer transverse line of the fore wings starts from a
  conspicuous creamy patch on the front margin, and the line on the hind
  wings is most distinct above the anal angle, where it runs through a
  purplish cloud (Plate <a href="#plate33">33</a>, Fig. 5).</p>

  <p>In April and May the pale blue eggs are laid on the underside of birch
  leaves. The caterpillar in June feeds on the foliage of the birch, and
  when full grown is green freckled with yellowish above; a darker line
  runs along the middle of the back, and a reddish spotted, or tinted,
  yellow stripe along the sides; the small head, also green, is marked with
  yellowish. When the chrysalids are kept indoors the moths emerge earlier
  than in the open, and it therefore sometimes happens that eggs are laid
  and the caterpillars hatch before the birch leaves are ready for them. In
  such cases I have got over the difficulty in a measure by removing a
  portion of the outer covering of one or two of the most forward buds to
  give the caterpillars a chance of getting at the unexposed leaves. The
  moth emerges in April or May, and, as pointed out by Mr. R. Adkin, it
  sometimes remains in the chrysalis for two winters. Possibly this species
  may be found in most districts where birch abounds; but, so far as its
  distribution in our islands is known, it certainly appears to be
  distinctly local. Besides Darenth, it also occurs in West Wickham Wood,
  and at Wateringbury, in Kent; the Weybridge district, Dorking, and
  Haslemere, in Surrey; Ashdown Forest, Blackdown Woods, Haywards Heath,
  and Tilgate Forest, in Sussex; New Forest, Hampshire, and Berkshire.
  There seems to be no record of the moth having been found in any other
  part of England, except Keswick and Windermere. In Scotland it has been
  reported from Galashiels, Clydesdale, the Tay district, Argyleshire, and
  Moray.</p>

<h5><b>The Plumed Prominent</b> (<i>Ptilophora plumigera</i>).</h5>

  <p>The thinly scaled fore wings are ochreous brown in the male, and
  purplish brown in the female, and the markings, which are most in
  evidence in the male, are yellowish. Hind wings, more sparsely scaled
  than the fore wings, are pale ochreous brown in the male and darker in
  the female. It varies in the tint of general colour and in the intensity
  of the yellowish markings. In the female the antennæ are simple, but in
  the male they are very plume-like, hence the English name. Buckler
  describes the caterpillar as whitish blue-green, with a broad deep green
  stripe down the middle of the back, and a narrow yellow line on each side
  of it; spiracular line slender, white, and wavy; head rather small,
  glossy, yellowish green. When quite full grown and mature it changes to a
  uniform semi-transparent green, like the underside of a leaf of maple,
  upon which, and also sycamore, the caterpillar feeds in May and early
  June. Maple bushes growing in hedgerows are usually selected by the
  female moths when laying their eggs. These are placed on the twigs near a
  bud, and may be searched for at any time from November until April. The
  moth is shown on Plate <a href="#plate33">33</a>.</p>

  <p>This species was figured by Stephens (1828) as <i>Ptilophora
  variegata</i> and the only locality then known to him was Darenth Wood,
  where, he states, the caterpillar was obtained almost every year. It
  still occurs in Kent and possibly in its old haunt; it is also recorded
  from Watergate, Sussex; South Devon (Torquay district); and
  Gloucestershire. In Bucks, Berks, and Oxfordshire it is more frequent
  than in either of the counties previously mentioned, and in all it seems
  to be found chiefly in chalky localities. The moth, which is on the wing
  in November <!-- Page 80 --><span class="pagenum" title="124.png"><a
  name="page80"></a>{80}</span>or sometimes in late October, has rarely
  been taken when flying at night or resting by day. Light has an
  attraction for the male, but apparently not for the female.</p>

  <p>Distributed through Central Europe, its range extends to Southern
  Scandinavia, Northern Italy, Livonia, Bulgaria, S.E. Russia, and
  Japan.</p>

<h5><b>The Pale Prominent</b> (<i>Pterostoma palpina</i>).</h5>

  <p>This blackish streaked, pale brownish grey moth has been known as the
  Pale Prominent since 1775, when Moses Harris gave it this name. Beyond
  the black scaled tooth-like projection the inner margin is notched. The
  antennæ of the female are pectinated, but the teeth are shorter than
  those of the male; and the blackish streak on the wings are usually less
  defined. Except that some specimens are more strongly marked than others
  there is little to note in the way of aberration. Mr. Harwood of
  Colchester has, however, recorded an almost black variety, and this may
  be referable to the form from Russian Lapland, known as var.
  <i>lapponica</i>, Teich. The moth is figured on Plate <a
  href="#plate33">33</a>, and the early stages on Plate <a
  href="#plate32">32</a>.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is bluish green, with white lines along the back and
  sides, and a black edged yellow stripe along the spiracles; the stripe is
  marked with reddish on the three rings nearest the head. It feeds chiefly
  on poplar, but has been found on willow and sallow. Usually to be
  obtained full grown early in July or late in June; in the south and
  south-east of England, it is found also in September and October. The
  chrysalis is purplish, or reddish, brown and rather shining. It may be
  found, in a cocoon formed of silk mixed with particles of earth, among
  the roots of grass, etc., at the foot of poplar or willow trees. Moths
  are on the wing in May and June, and again in July and August. Coming to
  electric and gas lamps, as well as entering lighted rooms, and
  illuminated moth traps, they are often secured; otherwise they are rarely
  seen in a state of nature. The species is most frequent, perhaps, in the
  southern countries, but seems to occur throughout England; it becomes
  scarcer from the Midlands northwards to Durham and Cumberland. It occurs
  in Southern Scotland, and has been recorded from Moray. In Ireland it is
  widely distributed, but is not noted as common in any locality. The range
  abroad extends through temperate Europe into Asia Minor, and as far east
  as China and Japan.</p>

<h5><b>The Buff-tip</b> (<i>Phalera bucephala</i>).</h5>

  <div class="figright" style="width:21%;">
      <a href="images/fig21.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig21.jpg"
      alt="Fig. 21." title="Fig. 21." /></a>
    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig. 21.</span></p>

    <p style="text-align:center"><b>Eggs of Buff-tip Moth.</b></p>
  </div>

  <p>This species (Plate <a href="#plate35">35</a>, Fig. 3) is easily
  recognized by its violet-grey fore wings, and the more or less round,
  pale, ochreous blotch on the outer third. The blotch is clouded, to a
  greater or lesser extent, with pale brown, and the inner area of the
  wings is flecked with silvery grey; the cross lines are edged with
  reddish brown.</p>

  <p>The rather downy caterpillar is yellow, with several interrupted
  blackish lines, and of these the one along the middle of the back is the
  broadest and blackest; head black. It feeds, during August and September,
  in companies, until nearly full grown, and the foliage of almost any kind
  of tree or bush appears to be suitable food, although that of elm, lime,
  and hazel is often selected by the female moth when depositing her
  whitish eggs, which <!-- Page 82 --><span class="pagenum" title="128.png"
  ><a name="page82"></a>{82}</span>she lays in neatly arranged batches on
  the undersides of the leaves. If undisturbed, a company of these
  caterpillars quickly clear a fair-sized branch of all leafage. The
  chrysalis is purplish brown (the early stages are shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate37">37</a>).</p>

  <p>The moth flies in June and July, but is rarely seen in the daytime.
  The wings in repose are closely folded down to the body and the insect
  has then a very stick-like appearance, and may thus easily escape
  detection.</p>

  <p>Occurs throughout England and Wales, Ireland, and Scotland. It is most
  common, and the caterpillar often abundant, in London and its suburbs, as
  well as other southern parts of the country. Its range extends through
  Europe to Northern Asia Minor, Armenia, and Siberia.</p>

<h5><b>The Chocolate-tip</b> (<i>Pygæra curtula</i>).</h5>

  <p>Two examples of this moth are shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate35">35</a>. Fig. 2 represents the spring (April and May)
  form, and Fig. 1 the summer (July and August) form. Sometimes there is a
  third brood, in September or October, and Barrett describes the
  individuals of this as "pale drab, dusted with darker atoms, and with the
  chocolate blotch paler towards the apex." Hybrids have been obtained from
  a pairing between <i>curtula</i> female and <i>anachoreta</i> male, and
  these were most like the female parent. The early stages are figured on
  Plate <a href="#plate34">34</a>, Figs. 1-1<i>c</i>.</p>

  <p>The verdigris-green eggs are laid in batches on the leaves of poplar
  and aspen, upon which the caterpillars feed in May and June, and, as a
  second brood, in August and September. In colour the caterpillar, which
  is rather hairy, is grey, with a pinkish tinge, sprinkled with black, and
  with orange spots on the sides; there is a raised black spot on the
  fourth ring, and another on the eleventh; head blackish. The chrysalis is
  reddish-brown, spun up in a packet of leaves. This species appears to be
  less common in England than formerly. It is, <!-- Page 83 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="129.png"><a name="page83"></a>{83}</span>perhaps,
  more often observed in Kent and Sussex than in the other counties it
  inhabits, which, according to Barrett, are Berks, Essex, Suffolk,
  Norfolk, Cambridge, in all of which it is local; also, but more rarely,
  in Gloucestershire, Worcestershire, Herefordshire, Leicestershire,
  Yorkshire, and Cumberland, the latter county being its northern limit. To
  the above may be added Hertfordshire and Middlesex. Although caterpillars
  are reported to have been found in Ireland, the moth has not been reared
  in that country.</p>

  <p>This species is distributed through Northern and Central Europe,
  extending to South France, Corsica, North Italy, Bulgaria, Armenia, and
  Mongolia.</p>

<h5><b>The Scarce Chocolate-tip</b> (<i>Pygæra anachoreta</i>).</h5>

  <p>This moth is distinguished from that last referred to by the black
  spots in and just below the blotch at the tip of the fore wings; the
  blotch itself is dull reddish, merging outwardly into greyish, and is
  intersected by a white line. There is some variation in the tint of the
  general colour, ranging from dusky to reddish grey, but otherwise the
  species is constant (Plate <a href="#plate35">35</a>, Figs. 4, 5).</p>

  <p>The caterpillar, which feeds on poplar and sallow from May to August,
  or even later, is rather hairy, dark grey or blackish in colour; there
  are four ochreous or whitish lines on the back, and a row of black spots
  followed by a series of orange ones on the sides; below the spiracles are
  some yellowish markings; the raised spots on rings four and eleven are
  reddish brown; the former has a white spot on each side, and the back of
  the latter is edged with white; head black and rather glossy. Chrysalis
  blackish in hue, spun up among leaves. The moths emerge in May, and again
  in July; in confinement there is sometimes a third brood in September.
  Except that two <!-- Page 84 --><span class="pagenum" title="130.png"><a
  name="page84"></a>{84}</span>specimens were reported as found in a street
  at Deal, the moth does not seem to have been noticed at large.</p>

  <p>This species was known to Haworth, but, as a British insect, was
  exceedingly rare until 1859, when Dr. Knaggs found some caterpillars upon
  poplar in the neighbourhood of Folkestone. From the stock then obtained
  the moths were reared in numbers for some time. Batches of eggs were also
  put down in various localities, and the species seems to have flourished
  in some of them for a while, but failed eventually to establish itself in
  any of them. Then the species disappeared from the Folkestone locality,
  although a caterpillar or two were found there in 1861, and on to 1912 in
  other places on the Kentish coast. In 1893 eggs were obtained at St.
  Leonard's, in Sussex, and thus originated a new stock.</p>

  <p>The species has a wide range in Central and Northern Europe, extending
  to some of the southern parts; it also occurs in Siberia, Amurland,
  China, and Japan.</p>

<h5><b>The Small Chocolate-tip</b> (<i>Pygæra pigra</i>).</h5>

  <p>This species will be recognized by its smaller size and less distinct
  chocolate blotch on the tips of the fore wings. The ground colour varies
  from whitish grey to pale brownish grey; the pale cross lines are usually
  well defined; the first is bordered with chocolate colour, and angled
  above the middle; the third line runs from a white spot on the costa and
  through the chocolate patch. The moth is shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate35">35</a>, and the early stages on Plate <a
  href="#plate34">34</a>.</p>

  <p>Of the offspring resulting from eggs laid by a female <i>curtula</i>
  that had paired with a male <i>pigra</i>, and also those from a female
  <i>pigra</i> crossed with a male <i>curtula</i>, the hybrids in each case
  most nearly resembled the female parent.</p>

  <p>The eggs are pale olive green tending to brownish, and all that I have
  seen have been laid in irregular lines on leaves, or <!-- Page 85
  --><span class="pagenum" title="131.png"><a
  name="page85"></a>{85}</span>on the sides of a chip box. The caterpillar
  is greyish, with some short hairs and black dots; the back is broadly
  marked with yellow, and there is a yellow stripe, with black dots on it,
  low down on the sides; rings four and eleven have each a raised black
  spot; head blackish. Feeds from June to September, on dwarf sallow
  (<i>Salix repens</i>), and also on young plants of aspen. Like other
  caterpillars of this genus, it hides by day in a packet of leaves spun
  together. There are certainly two broods, if not more, in the year. The
  moth emerges in May, and more irregularly in July or August, and October.
  Except when attracted to a light, the moth is rarely seen, but in fens,
  marshes, and boggy places generally, the caterpillars may often be
  obtained in numbers almost throughout the United Kingdom. Its
  distribution abroad embraces Northern and Central Europe, with extension
  into Northern Spain and Italy; Bulgaria, South-east Russia, and
  Armenia.</p>

<h5 class="lg125">THYATIRIDÆ.</h5>

  <p>The nine British species next to be considered belong to the old
  family Cymatophoridæ, but as the name <i>Cymatophora</i>, as indicated by
  Hübner in the "Tentamen" (1816), is now generically used by authors for
  some species of Geometridæ; and as Hübner's <i>Verzeichniss</i> generic
  names will have to be used for the species previously included in
  <i>Cymatophora</i>, Tr., the term Thyatiridæ has here been adopted for
  this family&mdash;the Polyplocidæ of Meyrick and others.</p>

<h5><b>The Buff Arches</b> (<i>Habrosyne derasa</i>).</h5>

  <p>This pretty species (Plate <a href="#plate36">36</a>, Figs. 1, 2) is
  well distributed over the greater part of England and not at all uncommon
  in the more sylvan districts of the southern counties. It occurs in Wales
  but has only once been recorded from Scotland. In <!-- Page 86 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="132.png"><a name="page86"></a>{86}</span>Ireland
  it is found in almost every well-wooded locality, but is not generally
  common. The moth hides among the foliage of the bramble and also creeps
  under the withered leaves on the ground. It comes freely to sugar, and is
  often the earliest to attend the banquet, but is rather skittish at first
  and should be given time to settle down.</p>

  <p>The fore wings are pale olive grey with two whitish streaks across
  them, the first oblique approaching the second towards the inner margin;
  the space between the streaks is clouded with brownish buff and there is
  a whitish cloud on the costal area, and some strongly waved cross lines
  before the second streak.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar, which is rusty brown, with a blackish central line on
  the back, a black edged yellowish spot on ring four, a smaller one on
  ring five, and sometimes a tiny one on ring seven, feeds in August and
  September, sometimes later, on bramble, and is said to eat hawthorn and
  hazel. It hides during the day and comes up to feed at night. The
  chrysalis, which is enclosed in an earthen cocoon below the surface of
  the ground, or sometimes among moss, is purplish black with the ring
  divisions reddish; the anal spike is furnished with hooks. As a rule the
  moth does not emerge until June or July following the year of pupation,
  but it has been found on the wing in September and October.</p>

  <p>Distributed over Central Europe, extending into Southern France, and
  Northern Italy, Southern Sweden and Livonia, and eastward to the
  Himalayas, Corea, and Japan.</p>

<h5><b>The Peach-Blossom</b> (<i>Thyatira batis</i>).</h5>

  <p>The olive brown fore wings of this moth are adorned with five
  pink-tinged whitish spots, and clouded with brown; the pink tinge varies
  in amount and in brightness, and sometimes gives place to pale ochreous.
  The moth is figured on Plate <a href="#plate36">36</a>, and the early
  stages on Plate <a href="#plate37">37</a>.</p>

  <p>The fluted greenish-white eggs are laid upon the edges of
  bramble-leaves.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is pale reddish brown shaded with darker and freckled
  with whitish (in the young stage the second and third rings are whitish
  above); a slender dark brown line along the middle of the back, and a
  broader one along the sides, the latter not distinct on the first three
  rings; the two rings nearest the head each have a divided ridge, the
  second being the larger; there are also similar ridges on the fifth to
  ninth rings, and the back of ring eleven is slightly raised; a series of
  pale triangular marks on the back. It feeds on bramble in July, and may
  be found from that month until September.</p>

  <p>In confinement it will thrive on raspberry or the cultivated kinds of
  blackberry. From some thirty eggs I had in June this year (1907) the
  caterpillars hatched on the 27th; several of these fed up rapidly and one
  or two had spun up for pupation, among the leaves, in July (about 24th),
  whilst others remained quite small, and a few were in the last skin but
  one. Early in August the larger caterpillars just referred to pupated,
  and the smaller ones began to feed up, and by the end of the month they
  had attained to full growth, although they did not spin cocoons until the
  second week in September.</p>

  <p>From July chrysalids moths will often emerge in August or September of
  the same year, but none have appeared from those under observation. The
  chrysalis is pale brown mottled with dark purplish or reddish brown, wing
  cases reddish. The species frequents woods or wooded localities, and is
  generally distributed throughout England and Wales, but commoner in some
  parts than others. Rather local in Scotland but not uncommon in
  Perthshire. Sometimes very abundant in Ireland, occurring in similar
  localities to the preceding species. It is found over the greater part of
  Northern and Central Europe, and as far east as Amurland and Japan. <!--
  Page 88 --><span class="pagenum" title="136.png"><a
  name="page88"></a>{88}</span></p>

<h5><b>The Figure of Eighty</b> (<i>Palimpsestis octogessima</i>).</h5>

  <p>This moth (Plate <a href="#plate36">36</a>, Figs. 5, 6) may be
  distinguished by two whitish marks on the fore wings which have some
  resemblance to the numerals 80, hence the common name. These are really
  the white outlines of the reniform and orbicular stigmata, each of which
  has the central part filled in with black; sometimes the lower portion of
  the 8 is obscure, but in a general way the character is not difficult to
  make out.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is yellowish tinged with greyish on the back; a
  greyish plate on the back of the ring nearest the black marked orange
  head; three black spots on each side of the first ring, two such spots on
  ring two, and one on each side of rings three to eleven; the back of the
  last ring has a greyish plate. It feeds in July and August, earlier or
  later in accordance with season, on poplar. During the day it hides
  between united leaves, or in a curled up withered leaf, upon the tree.
  The shining black chrysalis with somewhat reddish ring divisions is
  enclosed in a rather loosely constructed cocoon spun up between leaves,
  or among moss etc., at the base of poplar trees. The moth emerges in May
  or June. It is partial to sugar, and is said to prefer its sweets served
  up on poplar trunks. Probably it is most often and regularly obtained in
  the Eastern Counties, but it is locally not uncommon in Worcestershire
  and Herefordshire; also found in Gloucestershire, Somerset,
  Hertfordshire, Middlesex, Surrey, and, I believe, Sussex. The range
  abroad is similar to that of <i>T. batis</i>.</p>

<h5><b>The Poplar Lutestring</b> (<i>Palimpsestis or</i>).</h5>

  <p>May be recognized in the typical form by the four-lined bands,
  "lutestrings," on the greyish, sometimes pink-tinged fore wings; the
  reniform and orbicular marks are often present although the first is
  generally obscure, and they never assume the similarity <!-- Page 89
  --><span class="pagenum" title="137.png"><a
  name="page89"></a>{89}</span>to figures noted in the last species (Plate
  <a href="#plate36">36</a>, Figs. 7, 8). In Scotland the moths have a
  paler ground colour generally, var. <i>scotica</i>, Tutt; one from
  Ireland with ground colour pearly white and broad black "lutestrings" has
  been named var. <i>gaelica</i>, Kane. Hybrids from a cross pairing of
  this species with the last have been obtained by Mr. W. H. B. Fletcher.
  These specimens have the "lutestrings" of <i>or</i>, and the "figure of
  80" characteristic of <i>octogessima</i>. Caterpillar yellowish green
  with a dark line along the middle of the back, and two black spots on the
  front edge of the ring next the yellowish brown head. It feeds on poplar,
  and hides between united leaves in the daytime; may be found from July to
  September or even later. Chrysalis, reddish brown, the surface minutely
  pitted, and spike pointed, and thickened at the base; in a brownish
  cocoon spun up between leaves. The moth emerges in June or July, and it
  comes freely to sugar, but like other members of this family is not
  always easy to box. It seems to occur in most places where poplar trees
  are well established; widely distributed over England, and found
  throughout Scotland even to the Shetland Isles. In Ireland it seems to be
  local and rare. Distribution abroad much as in the last species.</p>

<h5><b>The Lesser Satin Moth</b> (<i>Palimpsestis duplaris</i>).</h5>

  <p>Figs. 1, 2, on Plate <a href="#plate39">39</a>, represent the typical
  southern form of this species. The fore wings are pale greyish with a
  whitish edged, broad, dark central band; two black dots on the outer edge
  of the band distinguish this species from the next. In Scotland and in
  Northern England the general colour is blackish or purplish grey (Fig.
  3), and sometimes specimens more or less suffused with the darker colour
  are found in the southern half of England. Quite the darkest, almost
  black, form seems to occur in Cannock Chase, Staffordshire, and in
  Delamere Forest, Cheshire. The caterpillar is greenish; central area of
  the back <!-- Page 90 --><span class="pagenum" title="138.png"><a
  name="page90"></a>{90}</span>green, margined on each side by an olive
  green, or brighter green, stripe; some black dots along the sides; head
  reddish brown marked with black. Feeds on birch, and may be found from
  August to October. It spins the leaves together for a shelter during the
  daytime, and comes out to feed at night, when it may be obtained by
  beating the boughs. Other food plants mentioned are alder, oak, and
  hazel. The pupa is of a dull reddish colour, in a slight cocoon between
  leaves.</p>

  <p>Widely distributed throughout England and common in most woodlands,
  especially in the south and east; it ranges through Scotland to the
  Shetlands. In Ireland, where the moth has the ground colour silvery grey
  (var. <i>argentea</i>, Tutt), it has been obtained in many localities,
  from Donegal and Tyrone to Kerry and Cork.</p>

<h5><b>The Satin Carpet</b> (<i>Palimpsestis fluctuosa</i>).</h5>

  <p>In colour and general pattern this species (Plate <a
  href="#plate39">39</a>, Fig. 4) is very similar to the last in its
  typical form. The points of distinction are, the slightly larger size,
  whiter ground colour, and the absence of the two black dots from the edge
  of the band. In August and September the caterpillar feeds, at night, on
  birch, and by day conceals itself between leaves. It is reddish or violet
  grey above, and pale ochreous-white beneath; the lines down the centre of
  the back and along the sides are darker; on the first ring there is a
  greenish-tinged yellow plate, and from this to the eleventh ring there
  are two series of black dots along the back. Head yellow-brown, blackened
  above; a black circle on each cheek. Chrysalis reddish-brown, in a cocoon
  among leaves either on the tree or on the ground. The moth emerges in
  June, and is distinctly local. Sometimes it may be disturbed from its
  resting place among the foliage; it becomes active on the wing at dusk
  for a short time; sugar does not seem to possess any great attraction for
  it, anyway it does not attend the feast prepared for Noctuæ so frequently
  as other members of this family. It is known to occur, chiefly in woods,
  in Kent, Surrey, Sussex, and Hampshire in the south; Essex and Suffolk in
  the east; also in Worcestershire (Wyre Forest), and Herefordshire; in the
  Barnsley and Sheffield districts of Yorkshire; and it has been reported
  from Cumberland. In Ireland it is rare and only recorded from Killarney,
  Kerry, and Sligo. Abroad it occurs in Central Europe, the range extending
  to Southern Scandinavia, and to South-east Russia.</p>

<h5><b>The Lesser Lutestring</b> (<i>Asphalia diluta</i>).</h5>

  <p>The fore wings are whitish or greyish, and sometimes tinged with
  brown; crossed by two brownish bands. Variation is chiefly in the tint of
  the bands and also in their width and definition. In var.
  <i>nubilata</i>, which occurs in Yorkshire, the general colour of the
  fore wings is darker than normal, and there is a basal patch and three
  cross-bands of reddish or purplish brown (Plate <a
  href="#plate39">39</a>, Figs. 5, 6).</p>

  <p>Caterpillar, yellowish above and greyish beneath; a dusky line along
  the middle of the back, and one, dotted with black, low down on the
  sides; head dark brown, almost blackish. It feeds in May and June on oak,
  but only at night; it constructs a leafy chamber in which it sits tight
  during the day, and is not easily evicted unless its apartment is
  forcibly opened. The reddish chrysalis is enclosed in a flimsy cocoon
  between, or among, leaves. Although September is the month during which
  the moth usually emerges, it is sometimes seen earlier. It is so partial
  to sugar, that it may often be seen at an old patch before the new feast
  has been set out for the evening entertainment. The species is fairly
  well distributed throughout England and Wales, and most common in the
  south of the former country. It extends into Southern Scotland, but <!--
  Page 92 --><span class="pagenum" title="142.png"><a
  name="page92"></a>{92}</span>apparently does not occur in Ireland. Abroad
  it is found in Central Europe, Belgium, North Germany, North Italy, and
  North-east Asia Minor.</p>

<h5><b>The Yellow Horned</b> (<i>Polyploca flavicornis</i>).</h5>

  <p>In the South of England this species is greenish grey, sometimes
  speckled or dusted with darker grey; the reniform and orbicular marks are
  generally clear and distinct, but in some examples they are united and
  form a whitish blotch outlined in blackish; the cross lines are usually
  well defined, but in the dark grey dusted form are very obscure.
  Specimens from Scotland are generally larger, there is less green, if
  any, in the ground colour, and the markings are often more pronounced and
  brighter. This form is the var. <i>scotica</i>, Tutt, and may be more or
  less identical with the var. <i>finmarchia</i>, Schöyen, from Norway and
  Lapland (Fig. 7, Plate <a href="#plate39">39</a>, shows the English form,
  and Fig. 8 the Scotch form).</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is greenish, light olive green, or dark olive green
  above, and yellowish beneath; a line along the middle of the back is
  paler, and on each side there is a row of black spots and finely
  black-edged white dots; a line above the brownish outlined spiracles is
  yellowish: the head is yellow brown with blackish jaws and black mark on
  each cheek. It feeds in June and July on birch, preferring the foliage of
  bushes. During the daytime it resides in a leaf neatly folded in half;
  when quite young, the caterpillar then being blackish, a small leaf or
  just the turned-over edge of a large one answers its purpose. The
  chrysalis is reddish, enclosed in a flimsy cocoon among leaves, moss, or
  roots of grass, etc., sometimes just under the surface of the soil. The
  early stages are figured on Plate <a href="#plate38">38</a>, Figs.
  2-2<i>c</i>. The moth emerges in March or April of the year following
  pupation, as a rule, but it may remain in the chrysalis for two winters.
  It is often obtained in birch woods, or wherever there <!-- Page 93
  --><span class="pagenum" title="143.png"><a
  name="page93"></a>{93}</span>is a good growth of birch, by jarring the
  twigs and branches of birch upon which it rests during the day, or it may
  be found by searching the low bushes and underwood. Soon after dusk it is
  on the wing, and will then visit sugar and sallow bloom.</p>

  <p>Generally distributed throughout Great Britain. In Ireland it appears
  to be very rare. Its range abroad, in the typical form, extends over
  Northern and Central Europe to North Italy and to South-east Russia.</p>

<h5><b>The Frosted Green</b> (<i>Polyploca ridens</i>).</h5>

  <p>This moth (Plate <a href="#plate39">39</a>, Figs. 9, 10) is also on
  the wing early in the year, but although it is sometimes found on tree
  trunks in April or perhaps as late as the first week in May, it seems to
  be rarely obtained otherwise in the perfect state. It does not "come to
  sugar" often, if at all, and so far as is known, does not visit any of
  the usual natural attractions.</p>

  <p>The ground colour of the fore wings varies from whitish to green, but
  in some specimens the general hue is olive or blackish green, and the
  markings then appear to be wavy whitish lines crossing the wings, one
  near the base, and the other before the outer margin.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar (Plate <a href="#plate38">38</a>, Fig. 1) is yellow
  above and rather greenish beneath; a greenish grey double stripe along
  the back is interrupted at the ring divisions; there are also white dots
  with black or blackish edges on the back and the sides; a yellow line
  along the spiracle area is shaded above and below with greenish grey; the
  head, which is notched on the crown, is yellowish, with a black mark on
  each cheek. It feeds, at night, on oak, from May to July; hiding by day
  on the underside of a leaf, a portion of which is folded over and secured
  with silk, to form a suitable retreat. These caterpillars respond more
  readily to the persuasive beating-stick than others of the group.</p>

  <p>The species affects woodland localities in most of the southern <!--
  Page 94 --><span class="pagenum" title="144.png"><a
  name="page94"></a>{94}</span>counties of England, and it is also found in
  South Wales. Its range extends into the Eastern Counties and through the
  Midlands northward to Cumberland. It does not seem to have been noted
  from Scotland or Ireland. Abroad it is distributed over Central Europe
  and northward to Denmark and Livonia, and southward to South France and
  Andalusia.</p>

<h5><b>Tussock-moths</b> (<i>Lymantriidæ</i>).</h5>

  <p>About seventy-two species, referred to this family, are known to occur
  in various parts of the Palæarctic region; ten of these are found in our
  islands. The Black V-moth (<i>Leucoma v-nigrum</i> or <i>Arctornis
  l-album</i>) has been reported as British, but if the few examples that
  have been recorded were natives, the species has long since disappeared
  from this country.</p>

  <p>Some of the caterpillars, as, for example, those of the Brown and
  Yellow-tails, are not altogether pleasant to handle, as the hairs with
  which they are covered have a disagreeable trick of transferring
  themselves to our hands, whence they find their way to our face, and when
  there are apt to set up most unpleasant irritation and swelling of the
  parts affected. These urticating hairs are more troublesome when received
  from the caterpillar or cocoon, but those from the moth itself
  communicate a very respectable simulation of the skin trouble known to
  the doctor as Urticaria.</p>

<h5><b>The Scarce Vapourer</b> (<i>Orgyia gonostigma</i>).</h5>

  <p>The male of this species, and also of the next, flies in the sunshine,
  but the female of each is wingless, or nearly so, and has to remain at
  home on the cocoon from which she emerged. Here she lays a large number
  of eggs, from four to five hundred, upon the exterior. The eggs of this
  species are whitish and rather glossy when first laid; the top is sunken.
  Apart from <!-- Page 95 --><span class="pagenum" title="145.png"><a
  name="page95"></a>{95}</span>the deeper brown colour of the fore wings
  and the blacker hind wings, the male of this species has a white mark
  near the tip of each fore wing, and this character will distinguish it
  from the same sex of the Common Vapourer.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is blackish with star-like tufts of hair, white on the
  back and greyish on the sides; on rings four to seven are brushes of
  brown hairs; a pencil of black hair on side of the first ring pointing
  forward, and a thicker one on the back of ring eleven directed backward;
  the interrupted stripes along the back and sides are reddish orange,
  approaching vermilion; those along the back are united in front of the
  pencil on ring eleven, and those of the sides unite behind the pencil.
  Head glossy, black. The foliage of sallow, willow, and oak, is perhaps
  the more usual food, but it has been known to eat beech, elm, hawthorn,
  sloe, and nut, and has been found on meadow-sweet. The chrysalis is
  brown, inclining to yellowish between the rings, and the back is hairy;
  enclosed in a cocoon spun up among leaves or in any suitable cranny. The
  male and female moths are figured on Plate <a href="#plate40">40</a>
  (Fig. 3, 5), and the caterpillar and chrysalis on Plate <a
  href="#plate41">41</a>.</p>

  <p>The moths emerge in June, and from their eggs caterpillars result in
  July. These, feeding up quickly, attain the perfect state in late July or
  early August. Caterpillars from this second generation usually go into
  hibernation when quite small, and feed up in the following April and May;
  in confinement they may, however, get through their metamorphosis and
  reach the moth state in September or October. Sometimes it happens that a
  part of the summer brood of caterpillars will feed up straight away and
  produce moths in August; others, feeding and growing more slowly, assume
  the winged state in November; whilst a third portion will remain small
  and go into hibernation.</p>

  <p>This very local species used to be obtained in the Wimbledon district,
  but it has not been seen there for some years past. <!-- Page 96 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="146.png"><a name="page96"></a>{96}</span>Other
  localities for it are the Norfolk and Cambridge fens, Bewdley Forest in
  Shropshire, and Wyre Forest, Worcestershire; it is also found in some
  parts of Devonshire, Suffolk, Essex, and Yorks. Its range abroad extends
  through Northern and Central Europe, southward to North Spain, Piedmont,
  and Corsica, and eastward to Amurland, Corea, and Japan.</p>

<h5><b>The Vapourer</b> (<i>Orgyia antiqua</i>).</h5>

  <p>The male has the wings rather more ample than the same sex of the last
  species, the colour is a more ochreous red and there is a large white
  spot at the lower angle of the fore wings, but no white mark at the tips
  of these wings. Specimens from the north of England are rather darker
  than southern examples. In the course of temperature experiments it has
  been noted that the colour of the moth is darkened if the chrysalids are
  put in a refrigerator for a few weeks, and then brought into a mean
  temperature of 40° Fahr. In the female the appendages representing wings
  are somewhat larger than those of the female of the Scarce Vapourer, but
  are quite useless as organs of flight (Plate <a href="#plate40">40</a>,
  Figs. 4, 6).</p>

  <p>In general colour the caterpillar is violet or smoky grey; the
  markings on the back comprise a creamy, red-dotted line along the middle
  area, this is edged with black, and on each side of it is a series of
  raised red spots; the broken line along the sides is yellowish, and the
  four brushes of hair on the back are yellow, sometimes merging into brown
  above; the pencils of longer hairs are blackish on the ring nearest the
  head, and dark grey or brownish on the last ring. It may be found through
  the summer on the leaves of most trees and bushes. Chrysalis blackish,
  glossy, and rather hairy. The cocoons are spun up in the crevices of bark
  on tree trunks, or in the fork of a twig, under the eaves of an out-house
  or shed, on palings and fences, etc. The hairs of the caterpillar are
  mixed with the silk of the cocoon; the female lays her pale brownish
  eggs, which are minutely pitted and have a darker ring below the sunken
  top, on the outside of the cocoon, and there they remain through the
  winter.</p>

  <p>Generally distributed throughout the United Kingdom, but not so common
  in Ireland as in England and Scotland. It is quite a Cockney insect, and
  is found in almost every part of the Metropolis where there are a few
  trees. Occurs practically over the whole of Europe, and in North-east
  Asia Minor, Armenia, Siberia, Amurland, and North America.</p>

<h5><b>The Dark Tussock</b> (<i>Dasychira fascelina</i>).</h5>

  <p>The figures of the sexes of this species on Plate <a
  href="#plate40">40</a> represent the dark grey form. Sometimes the
  forewings are whitish grey and occasionally slaty grey; the cross lines
  may be stronger or fainter, and in some specimens are nearly absent; the
  yellowish colour usually seen on the cross lines may be missing, or, on
  the other hand, other parts of the wings may be stippled with yellowish.
  Laying her eggs in batches, the female carefully covers them with dark
  brown hairs from the tuft at the end of her body.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar (Plate <a href="#plate41">41</a>, Fig. 4) is blackish,
  with star-like tufts of hairs, yellow, mixed with longer blackish ones
  towards the head and tail, brownish grey on the middle portion; a brush
  of black hairs on rings four, five, and eleven, and of white hairs on
  six, seven, and eight. Head black. When full grown (Plate <a
  href="#plate42">42</a>, Fig. 3) the hairs of the body are greyish, and
  those of the brushes on the back are black flanked with white. When
  disturbed it rolls in a ring. It feeds on hawthorn, and various species
  of <i>Salix</i>, also on broom and ling. It hibernates when still small,
  in a silken cocoon-like envelope which it spins in the fork of a branch,
  or among the twigs of a bush; growth is completed in April or May, and
  the winged state attained in <!-- Page 98 --><span class="pagenum" title="150.png"
  ><a name="page98"></a>{98}</span>June or July. Sometimes the young
  caterpillars have been found in their winter quarters about the middle of
  July, and this would seem to imply that they occasionally lie dormant for
  two winters; at least this would appear to be so in Scotland whence such
  individuals have been recorded, with the additional information that they
  did not eat through the summer and that one was still alive in the
  following March. The chrysalis is glossy black, and hairy (Plate <a
  href="#plate42">42</a>, Fig. 3<i>a</i>).</p>

  <p>This is chiefly a northern insect, occurring most commonly on the
  Cheshire, Lancashire, and Cumberland coast. It is more generally
  distributed in Scotland and is often abundant on the moorlands. In
  Ireland three caterpillars were found by Mr. Kane in the Bog of Allen,
  and the species has also been recorded from Tullamore and Mullingar.
  Distribution: Northern and Central Europe, extending to the Altai.</p>

<h5><b>The Pale Tussock</b> (<i>Dasychira pudibunda</i>).</h5>

  <p>This moth is much commoner and more widely distributed in England than
  that last mentioned. The central area of the greyish white fore wings is
  subject to variation in width and also in tint; this latter may be darker
  or lighter than the example shown on Plate <a href="#plate40">40</a>, and
  the cross lines are in some specimens black and very distinct. The colour
  of the female ranges from pale greyish white through various tones of
  grey, and the bands on the hind wings may be as well defined as in the
  male. Black males of the species have been recorded.</p>

  <p>The hairy caterpillar is green or yellow, the former mottled with
  whitish and the latter with greenish; on rings 4 to 7 are thick brushes
  of yellow hairs, and on ring 11 there is a tuft of reddish hair; the back
  is marked with black between the brushes, and there are black spots on
  the sides of the hind rings. Sometimes the caterpillar is light or dark
  brownish and the brushes are then greyish, or tinged with pale reddish or
  blackish. Altogether it is a pretty creature, and as it is, or was
  previous to the modern "washing," common in hop gardens at picking time,
  it was christened the "hop dog." It may be found from July to September
  on the foliage of birch, hazel, oak, and many other trees, as well as on
  hop. The moth appears in May and June, and rests by day on herbage,
  especially on bracken in woods (see Fig. 6, p. <a href="#page7">7</a>);
  at night it comes readily to light, but specimens so obtained are
  generally of the female sex.</p>

  <p>It is most at home in the southern portion, but occurs throughout
  England and Wales, to Cumberland. Only doubtfully recorded from Scotland,
  but in Ireland it has occurred in Galway, Kerry, Waterford, Cork, and
  Wicklow.</p>

  <p>Distribution: Central and Northern Europe eastward to North-east China

<h5><b>The Brown-tail</b> (<i>Euproctis chrysorrh&oelig;a</i>).</h5>

  <p>Although sometimes found in the East and West of England, and even in
  Yorkshire and Durham, this appears to be essentially a coast species in
  Britain, and confined at that to Kent and Sussex, the former especially.
  Even in these favoured localities where it is usually abundant, it is,
  however, not always in evidence. The moths sit about at the end of July
  and early August on leaves of hawthorn, sloe, sea-buckthorn (<i>Hippophaë
  rhamnoides</i>), and wild rose, generally on the underside. Near the
  females will be found batches of eggs, which are covered with "fur" from
  the anal tuft of the female. The caterpillars hatch out in August, and
  while still very small go into hibernation in a common nest. In the
  spring, when active again, they construct a new habitation, and another
  or perhaps two more before they are full grown, about June. The chrysalis
  is very dark, almost blackish-brown, with tufts of hair, and the fairly
  substantial brownish cocoon in which it is enclosed <!-- Page 100
  --><span class="pagenum" title="154.png"><a
  name="page100"></a>{100}</span>is composed of silk and caterpillar hairs,
  and is spun up on the food-plant, often singly, but not infrequently,
  several are made up in a common silken covering.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is blackish with brownish warts, each bearing a tuft
  of brownish hairs; a row of tufts of white downy scales on each side of
  the back of rings four to eleven; the central line on the back is black,
  edged on each side by a red line of variable width from rings six to ten;
  a vermillion round spot on nine and ten. Head blackish.</p>

  <p>The moth is shown on Plates <a href="#plate43">43</a>, <a
  href="#plate45">45</a>, and the caterpillar on Plate <a
  href="#plate42">42</a>, Fig. 1.</p>

  <p>Distribution, Central and South Europe to North-west Africa and Asia
  Minor.</p>

  <p>In 1897 an appeal was made to British entomologists to refrain from
  taking many specimens of this species; while American entomologists were
  seeking power to compel local authorities to suppress the Brown-tail,
  which about that time was a new, and no doubt introduced, insect pest in
  the State of Massachusetts.</p>

<h5><b>The Yellow-tail</b> (<i>Porthesia similis</i>).</h5>

  <p>The male has usually only one black mark on the fore wings, but
  sometimes there are two, as seen in Fig. 5, Plate <a
  href="#plate43">43</a>; more rarely there is a dot or two towards the
  tips of the wings. The habit of the moth is to sit upon the foliage of
  bushes and the branches of trees, where it might easily be passed over
  for a fluffy white feather; occasionally it may be found on palings or
  even iron railings. About dark it is on the wing, and light has then a
  great attraction for it. The caterpillar is black with black and grey
  hairs; a vermillion stripe down the middle of the back has a black
  central line, and is expanded on rings four, eleven, and twelve; along
  each side there are tufts of snowy white fluffy scales; the back of rings
  four, <!-- Page 101 --><span class="pagenum" title="155.png"><a
  name="page101"></a>{101}</span>five, and eleven is velvety black and
  slightly raised, especially on ring four. Head black and glossy.</p>

  <p>The caterpillars hatch from the eggs, which are laid in batches, in
  August, hibernate, each in a silken case, and recommence feeding in the
  spring (Plate <a href="#plate42">42</a>, Figs. 1, 1<i>a</i>). In May,
  when nearly full grown, they separate and are then common objects on
  hawthorn hedges in many districts. They also feed on the foliage of oak,
  beech, birch, sallow, rose, apple, pear, and other fruit trees. Sometimes
  a nearly fully mature caterpillar has been found in August, this has
  pupated and produced a moth the same year. The chrysalis is rather hairy
  and of a brownish colour; the cocoon is similar to that of the last
  species. In late June and through July the moth is generally common
  throughout the Southern part of England, and as far northwards as
  Lancashire and Yorkshire. It has been very rarely seen in Scotland, and
  not at all in Ireland.</p>

  <p>Distribution, Central and South-eastern Europe, extending to Amurland,
  China, Corea, and Japan.</p>

<h5><b>The Reed Tussock</b> (<i>Lælia coenosa</i>).</h5>

  <p>This insect (Plate <a href="#plate45">45</a>) was formerly abundant in
  some parts of fenland, and was first met with, as a British species, at
  Whittlesea Mere about 1819 or 1820. It was subsequently found in Yaxley
  and Burwell fens. Up to 1860 it continued to occur freely in all stages,
  but by 1865 larvæ at a shilling per dozen, the price at which they had
  been sold by the reed cutters, were no longer obtainable, and they became
  so scarce that in the year 1871 or thereabouts, only two caterpillars
  were seen. The species was at that time seemingly on the decline, but a
  year or two later a good many males were attracted by the rays of a
  powerful lamp that had been set up at Wicken. Then the moths became fewer
  and fewer <!-- Page 102 --><span class="pagenum" title="156.png"><a
  name="page102"></a>{102}</span>until at last, somewhere about 1880, even
  the lamps would not draw a single specimen, and soon it appeared probable
  that the last of the Reed Tussock had been seen in the fens, its only
  known habitat in Britain.</p>

  <p>Caterpillar, dusky with a blackish stripe along the middle of the
  back; the raised dots are ochreous grey with pale yellowish brown hairs
  arising from them; there are four brushes of yellow hairs on the back,
  bunches of long hairs on the first ring extended over the brownish head,
  and a pencil of similar hairs on ring eleven directed backward. The food
  plants given are bur-reed (<i>Sparganium</i>), Stephens; <i>Cladium
  mariscus</i>, Barrett, and reed (<i>Phragmites communis</i>). Stephens
  states that the caterpillar and the moth were found at the end of July
  and beginning of August, but other authorities give August to June for
  the caterpillar, and July for the moth. The caterpillar described above,
  and of which a figure is given on Plate <a href="#plate44">44</a>, was
  obtained, together with eggs and cocoon, from Dr. Staudinger and Bang
  Haas, of Dresden. All are preserved examples.</p>

  <p>Abroad this species is found in Northern Germany and France, Hungary,
  Bulgaria, Amurland, China, Corea, and Japan.</p>

<h5><b>The White Satin Moth</b> (<i>Stilpnotia salicis</i>).</h5>

  <p>The English name of this species dates back to about 1773, and is a
  very suitable one for it, the fore wings being especially glossy and
  satin-like. It seems to be less generally distributed over the country
  than formerly, but it is still common in most years, and in many places;
  more particularly in the south of England, and on the Lancashire coast.
  Even yet it occurs in the suburbs of London, and on the southern side is
  sometimes not uncommon. In Scotland it appears to be rare; Barrett
  mentions it from Aberdeen, Pitcaple, Inverurie, Peterhead, and Ayrshire.
  Kane states that in Ireland the species, so far as he knew, only occurred
  in a locality near Ahascragh.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar, which is hairy and variegated with reddish and black
  and white, may be recognised by the large bright white marks on the back.
  It is often seen in the daytime on the boles or branches of poplars, as
  well as on the foliage. It frequently falls a victim to the parasitical
  flies, and it is probably due to these enemies that the species is less
  common in some years than in others. Besides poplar, it will feed upon
  sallow and willow. Hibernating when quite tiny, it reappears in April,
  and, feeding up, is ready to enter the chrysalis state in June or July,
  when it spins a flimsy silken cocoon among the leaves, or in some
  suitable cranny on the tree or bush. The moth is shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate43">43</a>, Fig. 6, and the caterpillar and chrysalis on
  Plate <a href="#plate44">44</a>, Fig. 2, 2<i>a</i>.</p>

  <p>The moth emerges in July or August, and may be found resting on or
  under the leaves, and on stems and branches of the trees upon which the
  caterpillar fed, or on palings, etc., adjacent thereto.</p>

  <p>Distribution, Northern and Central Europe, Iberia, Corsica, Italy,
  Balkan Peninsula, South-east Russia, North-east Asia Minor, and Armenia.
  In the Far East, including China, Corea, and Japan, it is represented by
  the var. <i>candida</i>, Staud.</p>

<h5><b>The Gipsy</b> (<i>Lymantria dispar</i>).</h5>

  <p>Up to some sixty-five years ago, this species (Plate <a
  href="#plate46">46</a>, Figs. 1 &#x2642;, 2 &#x2640;) seems to have
  flourished in a wild state in the fens of Norfolk and Cambridgeshire, and
  also in Huntingdonshire. Just how long it had been common in those
  localities history does not inform us, but about 1792 Donovan was unable
  to obtain a native specimen to figure. Stephens, however, writing in 1828
  states that at that time it abounded in the Huntingdonshire fens. "It is
  said," he remarks "to have been introduced into Britain by eggs imported
  by Mr. Collinson, but the abundance with which it occurs near <!-- Page
  104 --><span class="pagenum" title="160.png"><a
  name="page104"></a>{104}</span>Whittlesea, and the dissimilarity of the
  indigenous specimens (which are invariably paler, with stronger markings)
  to the foreigner, sufficiently refute that opinion." There appears to be
  no doubt that some time near 1840 the Gipsy moth began to decrease in
  numbers, and that about 1850 it had almost or quite ceased to exist, as a
  wildling, in England. At the present time, and probably since the date
  last mentioned, the species has been semi-domesticated, and so reared
  year by year, at first possibly direct from the original wild stock, but
  afterwards from fresh stock derived from eggs of foreign origin. Futile
  attempts have been made to re-establish the species in various parts of
  England, and also in Ireland. Such failure is curious, seeing that in
  America the accidental introduction of a few moths has resulted in the
  species becoming so numerous that at least one state has been expending
  thousands of dollars in endeavouring to destroy it. The eggs are laid in
  batches and covered with the down-like scales from the anal tuft of the
  female.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar hatches in April, and in warm weather feeds up pretty
  quickly. It is grey, covered with black dots and fine marks; the hairs
  arising in spreading tufts from the raised warts, are longer on the sides
  than on the back; these warts on the back on each side of the pale
  central line are bluish on rings one to five, and reddish thence to
  eleven. Head, pale brown marked with black. Feeds on the foliage of most
  fruit trees, also on oak, elm, sallow, hawthorn, and sloe.</p>

  <p>Chrysalis rather hairy, brownish in colour, in a fairly strong silken
  cocoon, which is spun up in any suitable angle.</p>

  <p>The moths appear in August, and there is a striking difference in the
  size and coloration of the sexes. The male is pale or greyish brown,
  lined and clouded with darker brown on the fore wings, and the female is
  whitish with brownish cross lines, and a black central V-mark on the fore
  wings.</p>

  <p>Distributed over the whole of the Palæarctic Region, except <!-- Page
  105 --><span class="pagenum" title="161.png"><a
  name="page105"></a>{105}</span>the most northern, and, as adverted to, it
  has now become a pest in parts of North America.</p>

<h5><b>The Black Arches</b> (<i>Lymantria monacha</i>).</h5>

  <p>Two examples of each sex of this moth are figured on Plate <a
  href="#plate46">46</a>, and these show the normal form of the species;
  the central markings of the fore wings vary in width and intensity, and
  in some specimens the whole of the central area is more or less filled up
  with black or sooty black. Sometimes the wings are partially suffused
  with blackish, and the normal markings are consequently somewhat
  obscured. Examples wholly suffused with black are referable to var.
  <i>eremita</i>, a form not uncommon on the continent, and modifications
  of it are found in a wild state in this country. By selecting parents
  showing a tendency to vary in the direction of this dark form, it has
  been found possible to obtain a good percentage of darkened specimens,
  some of them closely approximating to var. <i>eremita</i>.</p>

  <p>The early stages are figured on Plate <a href="#plate47">47</a>.</p>

  <p>The eggs of this species are laid in August in the chinks of bark on
  tree trunks, and do not hatch until the spring.</p>

  <p>Caterpillar, whitish varying to greyish, a deep brown stripe along the
  middle of the back with an irregular black line on each side of it; the
  stripe is interrupted by a whitish or greyish patch on rings seven to
  nine; on ring two there is a black mark, and occasionally red dots appear
  on eight and nine; black dots on the back and sides are furnished with
  hairs. Head, brownish marked with a paler tint. It feeds from April to
  July on the leaves of oak and various other trees, including apple and
  pine.</p>

  <p>The chrysalis, which is enclosed in a somewhat transparent silken
  cocoon spun up in a fissure of the bark, is brownish, hairy, and has a
  very glossy metallic appearance.</p>

  <p>The moth emerges at the end of July and in August. It flies <!-- Page
  106 --><span class="pagenum" title="162.png"><a
  name="page106"></a>{106}</span>at night, and may be seen resting by day
  on the trunks of trees. Although it occurs in most of the counties of
  England from Yorkshire southwards, and in some parts of Wales, it is
  nowhere so often met with as in the New Forest, Hants.</p>

  <p>Distribution, Central Europe extending to parts of Northern Europe,
  and southwards to North Italy and Greece, and eastwards to Ussuri and
  Japan.</p>

<h5><b>Lackeys and Eggars</b> (<i>Lasiocampidæ</i>).</h5>

  <p>Staudinger in his catalogue of Palæarctic Lepidoptera refers twenty
  genera comprising sixty-three species to this family. Of these, eleven
  species belonging to ten genera occur in the British Isles. According to
  some authorities a twelfth species, <i>Dendrolimus pini</i>, Linn.,
  should be included. This is the <i>Eutricha pini</i> of Stephens (1828)
  and the "Wild Pine tree Lappet moth" and "Pine tree Lappet" of the more
  ancient authors. The claim of this species to a place in the British list
  rests chiefly on a specimen captured in the Norwich Hospital, in July,
  1809, by Mr. Sparshall. Wilkes (1773) states that he once found a
  caterpillar near Richmond Park, but the moth was not reared. For
  generations the species now classified as Lasiocampidæ have been referred
  to Bombycidæ, but the silkworm (<i>Bombyx mori</i>) is typical of that
  family, which has but few genera in it, and none of them occur in Europe.
  Although some of the moths are of considerable size, most of them are not
  large. The general colour is some shade of brown. Both sexes have the
  antennæ bipectinated, but more strongly in the male than the female.</p>

  <p>In his treatment of the species here included under Lasiocampidæ,
  Tutt. ("A Natural History of the British Lepidoptera," vols. i., ii.)
  separates them into two families, Lachneidæ and Eutrichidæ. The first
  family is divided into five sub-families and the same number of tribes.
  The latter family has three sub-families and three tribes. The whole are
  embraced in a super-family styled Lachneides. Lasiocampidæ disappears as
  a family name, but the genus <i>Lasiocampa</i> is retained for
  <i>quercus</i>, L., whilst <i>trifolii</i>, Schiff., is referred to the
  genus <i>Pachygastria</i>, Hb., and these with <i>Aurivillia</i>, Tutt,
  not represented in Britain, constitute the Pachygastriidi tribe of the
  Pachygastriinæ, a sub-family of Lachneidæ. All this will no doubt appear
  very complicated to the beginner, but he need not worry himself very
  greatly about the matter at present. When he feels that he has a fair
  knowledge of the species in the group he will be in a position to grapple
  with the niceties of classification.</p>

<h5><b>The Lackey</b> (<i>Malacosoma neustria</i>).</h5>

  <p>The colour of the male ranges from pale yellow ochre, through pale
  brown to reddish or dark brown; and in the female from pale brown to
  reddish brown; two cross lines are generally present on the fore wings;
  the space between the lines is usually darker in the female, and
  sometimes in the male also, forming a dark central band. All these colour
  forms were reared from some caterpillars taken by myself at Byfleet,
  Surrey, in 1901. Another year a few caterpillars taken at Esher produced
  ochreous coloured males and pale brown females only; the bands of the
  latter were narrower than usual and much contracted below the middle. As
  the females last mentioned are somewhat under the normal size I am
  inclined to think that the caterpillars from which they were reared had
  been on short commons during their last stage. Two males and a female are
  shown on Plate <a href="#plate48">48</a>.</p>

  <p>The greyish brown eggs are laid during July and August in a ring
  cluster around a twig as shown on Plate <a href="#plate49">49</a>, and so
  they remain exposed to all weathers during the winter. In April the
  caterpillars hatch out, and as they live in company throughout the
  greater part of their larval existence, the first business is to <!--
  Page 108 --><span class="pagenum" title="166.png"><a
  name="page108"></a>{108}</span>construct a silken tent-like web (Fig.
  22). The exterior of the tent affords a suitable surface upon which they
  can lie when they take a sun bath, which they seem fond of doing whenever
  the opportunity offers. It is also used, as well as the interior, for the
  process of skin-changing.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:30%;">
      <a href="images/fig22.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig22.jpg"

    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig. 22.</span> <b>Web of
    Lackey Caterpillars.</b> (Photo by W. J. Lucas.)</p>
  </div>

  <p>The full-grown caterpillar is slaty blue above; along the middle of
  the back is a bluish white line, bordered on each side by a
  reddish-orange-lined black stripe; towards the lower limit of the slaty
  blue colour is a black edged reddish-orange line, and below this again
  the ground colour is flecked with orange, sometimes forming a line in the
  region of the spiracles; there are two velvety black spots on the back of
  the ring nearest the head, and a smaller black spot on each side of the
  next two rings; the hairs are brownish, rather more numerous on the sides
  than on the back. Head slaty-blue with two black eye-like spots. It feeds
  from April to June on hawthorn, sloe, and various fruit trees in orchards
  and gardens; also on birch, elm, oak, sallow, willow, etc.</p>

  <p>Chrysalis blackish, rather downy enclosed in a double <!-- Page 109
  --><span class="pagenum" title="167.png"><a
  name="page109"></a>{109}</span>oval-shaped cocoon; the inner compartment
  is of rather closer woven silk, and is thickly covered with a yellowish
  substance, which is ejected by the caterpillar as a fluid, and afterwards
  drying forms a sulphur-like powder on the cocoon, and in a lesser degree
  on the chrysalis also. The moth is on the wing in July and August, but it
  is rarely seen in the daytime, and not often at night, except when
  attracted by light into the house, or to the gas or electric lamps. It is
  exceedingly easy to rear, either from eggs or from collected
  caterpillars; the latter are often abundant.</p>

  <p>Generally distributed throughout England, but becoming scarcer from
  the Midlands to Lancashire and Yorkshire, and not often occurring further
  north than the last named county. In Ireland it is unknown in the north,
  but occurs in many parts of the south and south-west.</p>

<h5><b>The Ground Lackey</b> (<i>Malacosoma castrensis</i>).</h5>

  <p>This also is a variable species. Most frequently the fore wings of the
  male are pale buff, cross lined, and more or less clouded with brown;
  hind wings brown. The female has all the wings reddish brown, the front
  pair being crossed by two pale buff lines. The fringes are pale buff,
  chequered with brown in both sexes. Colour and marking are, however,
  subject to considerable variation. Sometimes all the wings are pale buff
  (male), or reddish brown (both sexes), and the fore wings without
  marking. The cross lines on fore wings of the female may be either very
  slender or very broad; occasionally almost the whole of the basal area up
  to, and including, the first cross line is buff. Two examples of each sex
  are shown on Plate <a href="#plate48">48</a>.</p>

  <p>The eggs are laid in a similar manner to those of the last species,
  around stems of wild carrot, sea wormwood, and other <!-- Page 110
  --><span class="pagenum" title="168.png"><a
  name="page110"></a>{110}</span>plants that flourish in the insects'
  favourite haunts, which, in this country, are the salt marshes along the
  estuaries of the Thames and Medway.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is black, inclining to bluish between the rings; along
  the back are four much broken reddish orange lines and a central bluish
  line; a bluish stripe followed by a reddish one along the sides, and
  below this the colour is bluish, speckled with black; the hairs are
  golden brown. Head blackish grey, without black spots (Plate <a
  href="#plate49">49</a>, Fig. 3).</p>

  <p>The chrysalis and its cocoon are similar to those of the Lackey, and
  spun up among herbage.</p>

  <p>The moth emerges in July and August and, although it may be
  occasionally attracted by light, is rarely seen in the open. The
  caterpillars are to be found, most years, in plenty from May to July.
  They feed on almost every kind of plant growing on the salterns, and as
  they are fond of sunning themselves on sea wormwood, sea plantain, etc.,
  are easily seen at such times. In dull weather they retire to their webs,
  which are generally rather low down in the herbage. In confinement they
  will do very well if supplied with fresh sprays or leaves of almost any
  fruit tree, or of birch, whitethorn, etc. The receptacle containing them
  should be constructed and placed so that the caterpillars get plenty of
  air and sunshine. It is considered desirable to sprinkle both food and
  caterpillars with water now and then; some rearers deem it necessary to
  put a tiny pinch of salt in the water used for sprinkling; and in my own
  experience I have found that better results were obtained when the food
  was thus treated than when the salt was omitted.</p>

  <p>On the continent this species occurs in woods, and on heaths, etc.,
  but in Britain it is seemingly confined to salt marshes. Although it has
  been recorded from the Suffolk coast, and other places, the best
  localities for it are probably the salterns, from Gravesend to the Isle
  of Sheppey, and at Southend and Shoeburyness.</p>

  <p><i>Malacosoma</i> hybr. <i>schaufussi</i>, Standf.&mdash;In 1884 Dr.
  Standfuss made some experiments in crossing three species of
  <i>Malacosoma</i>, and one of these was the pairing of <i>M. neustria</i>
  &#x2642; with <i>M. castrensis</i> &#x2640;; the offspring he christened
  as above. Since that time others have succeeded in crossing the two
  species with varying results.</p>

  <p>On August 13, 1906, Mr. Percy Richards sent me a small batch of eggs
  (Plate <a href="#plate49">49</a>, Fig. 2<i>a</i>) laid by a female, <i>M.
  castrensis</i>, that emerged in a breeding cage, and had paired with a
  captured male, <i>M. neustria</i>, he introduced. The larvæ hatched out
  one or two at a time, from April 7 over a period of more than a
  fortnight. Few of the caterpillars would commence to feed, and of those
  that took to the plum and sallow with which they were supplied, only four
  reached maturity. Three of these pupated during late June and early July,
  and three moths, all females, have emerged up to date, one on July 28,
  another on August 6, and a third on August 13. The second specimen was
  very much crippled, probably owing to the cocoon having been accidentally
  injured. One caterpillar was still feeding on August 14, but died about
  the 26th.</p>

  <p>The mature larva (Plate <a href="#plate49">49</a>, Fig. 2) has the
  head and markings thereon like <i>neustria</i>, also the black spots on
  the first thoracic segment, but they are rather large and inclined to
  unite. The bluish line along the sides is dotted and freckled with black
  rather more thickly than in <i>castrensis</i>; the dorsal line is very
  thin, but bluish as in <i>castrensis</i>, and the red lines on each side
  of it are broad.</p>

  <p>In colour the three moths are deeper brown than any form of either
  parent species that I have seen, but the transverse lines, and especially
  the outer, are most like those of <i>neustria</i>.</p>

  <p>It should be mentioned that much information on Hybridism in the
  Lackey moths and other species will be found in Tutt's "British
  Lepidoptera," vol. ii. <!-- Page 112 --><span class="pagenum" title="172.png"
  ><a name="page112"></a>{112}</span></p>

<h5><b>The Pale Oak Eggar</b> (<i>Trichiura cratægi</i>).</h5>

  <p>In its typical form the male of this species (Plate <a
  href="#plate50">50</a>, Figs. 1, 2) is ashy grey, with a darker central
  band on the fore wings; and the female is dusky greyish-brown, also with
  a darker band. The colour of the male varies in shade from almost whitish
  (var. <i>pallida</i>, Tutt), to blackish grey; in the paler forms the
  central band of the fore wings is often of a purplish tint, and in the
  darkest forms the band is almost black. The female var. <i>pallida</i>,
  is pale buff.</p>

  <p>The eggs, which are brownish, inclining to reddish on the micropylar
  area, are covered with dark grey hairs from the body of the female and
  laid side by side in a chain-like arrangement on a twig of hawthorn or
  sloe (those figured on Plate <a href="#plate51">51</a> were deposited in
  a box, and not securely attached). From eight to twelve is said to be the
  usual number in a batch, and each female will deposit an average of 160
  eggs.</p>

  <p>The caterpillars do not hatch out all at the same time, but by ones
  and twos, at intervals spreading over a period of two, or perhaps three,
  weeks. Several forms of the caterpillar have been described, but the
  ground colour is generally more or less black above and greyish on the
  sides; the ornamentation comprises interrupted white or whitish stripes,
  streaked or clouded with reddish, and reddish warts; the hairs are
  reddish brown. The example figured on Plate <a href="#plate51">51</a> was
  from eggs laid by a female moth in Selkirk, South Scotland. From the age
  of three weeks until it became full grown it was black marked with yellow
  on the back and orange on the sides; hairs pale greyish mixed with black
  ones, especially on the back towards the black, glossy, and somewhat
  hairy head. It hatched on April 26, was reared on plum, pupated early in
  June, and the moth, a darkish grey female, emerged on July 31. Another
  caterpillar that hatched on May 1, and two others from still later
  hatchings, were then in chrysalis.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar may be found from April to June on hawthorn and sloe,
  and it is said also on birch, oak, sallow, apple, bramble, etc. Those
  that I have found resting by day on shoots of hawthorn, apparently
  enjoying the sunshine, have almost invariably been "ichneumoned"; but
  others that came up after sunset to feed on the shoots were generally
  healthy. Usually the caterpillar feeds up and pupates the same year, but
  on the moors in Aberdeenshire and some other parts of Scotland it is said
  to hibernate and to complete its life cycle the following summer and
  autumn. Furthermore, the moths from these winter larvæ are much darker
  than normal, and have been doubtfully referred to var. <i>ariæ</i>,
  Hübn., a form found in the Alps, Scandinavia, and Finland.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in August and September, and occurs in wooded
  districts throughout the southern half of England, but northwards from
  the Midlands it is uncommon; it is found in several parts of Scotland to
  Inverness. In Ireland it is reported (Birchall) to have occurred in
  Killarney, and Kane mentions that "a blackish form was taken at
  Magilligan, near Derry, by W. Salvage. Its larvæ were feeding on
  blackthorn." The range abroad extends through Europe to Armenia and Asia
  Minor.</p>

<h5><b>The December Moth</b> (<i>P&oelig;cilocampa populi</i>).</h5>

  <p>This is a rather thinly scaled moth; the general coloration is sooty
  brown; the wings are suffused more or less with greyish; there are two
  pale ochreous cross lines on the fore wings, the first enclosing a
  reddish brown basal patch; hind wings rather paler with a diffuse whitish
  central band; fringes brown chequered with pale ochreous. Head brown,
  collar brownish, tipped with pale ochreous in the male. The female is
  rather larger than the male. The moth is figured on Plate <a
  href="#plate50">50</a>, and the eggs and caterpillar on Plate <a
  href="#plate53">53</a>.</p>

  <p>The eggs, which are laid on the bark of trees, are whitish grey,
  variegated or mottled with darker grey. <!-- Page 114 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="176.png"><a name="page114"></a>{114}</span></p>

  <p>The caterpillar hatches out in April, and when nearly full grown is
  ochreous, but so thickly dotted and freckled with black as to appear of a
  dark brown coloration; the back is clothed with dark short hairs, and the
  sides with long paler hairs; on the back of the first ring is a reddish
  brown mark divided by a white line; a double row of whitish dots along
  the back, most distinct on rings two and three, where they are placed on
  a velvety black bar; on each side of the white dots is a reddish brown
  interrupted line. Head ochreous brown, thickly dotted with black and
  clothed with pale hairs. Underparts ochreous, spotted and lined with
  blackish. Feeds on the foliage of most trees, and is said to eat lettuce.
  April to June.</p>

  <p>Chrysalis glossy red brown, in a cocoon spun up among dead leaves,
  etc., under loose bark, or on the ground.</p>

  <p>The moth does not emerge until October, and in that month, but more
  frequently in November and December, the males may be seen around gas
  lamps quite late at night.</p>

  <p>Although found chiefly in woods it is not essentially a woodland
  species, as it occurs in districts where there are no woods but plenty of
  trees growing in parks, fields, or even hedgerows. It is fairly common
  generally throughout England and Wales, but becoming rather more local
  northwards to Cumberland. It occurs through Scotland to Sutherland, but
  is nowhere common. In Ireland it is widely distributed, and not uncommon
  near Dublin, and at Favour Royal, Tyrone. Abroad it ranges through
  Northern and Central Europe.</p>

<h5><b>The Small Eggar</b> (<i>Eriogaster lanestris</i>).</h5>

  <p>Also a brownish insect with somewhat thinly-scaled wings. The fore
  wings are light reddish brown with a whitish patch at the base, a white
  spot about the centre, and a whitish transverse line beyond; the hind
  wings are smoky brown and have a pale central band. The female, which is
  larger than the male, has a conspicuous greyish anal tuft, the hairs from
  which she uses to cover over her pale oily green eggs when they are
  deposited in clusters on twigs of hawthorn or sloe in February or March.

  <p>The caterpillar is black or greyish black, with reddish brown hairs,
  and a series of black-edged yellowish brown, or reddish brown blotches on
  each side of the back; these blotches are outlined in pale yellowish and
  occasionally connected by a line of the same colour. From the time they
  are hatched until nearly mature the caterpillars live in companies on a
  closely woven web of silk on a branch of hawthorn or sloe, only leaving
  their habitation to feed. These webs may often be seen on hedgerows from
  May to July. The brown chrysalis is enclosed in a solid-looking oval
  cocoon of a pale ochreous or whitish colour. Not all the moths emerge the
  following year: some will remain in the chrysalis over two or three
  winters, and occasionally they have been known to emerge seven years
  after pupation. The moth is said to be fully formed within the chrysalis
  all the time, but for some reason will not emerge, although if extracted
  from its shell, the moth has been known to expand its wings in the
  ordinary way. Barrett states that in the middle of February, after a moth
  had emerged, he "put a large number of cocoons upon a warm mantelpiece
  and obtained scores of moths within a few hours."</p>

  <p>Generally distributed over the southern half of England; plentiful in
  some years in the Southern and Eastern Counties. Northwards and in
  Scotland it is local and less frequent. Kane states that in Ireland it is
  very locally abundant. The range abroad is through Central and Northern
  Europe to Southern Lapland, and eastward to Siberia and Amurland.</p>

<h5><b>The Oak Eggar</b> (<i>Lasiocampa quercus</i>).</h5>

  <p>The three moths, one male and two females, shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate52">52</a>, were reared from caterpillars obtained in Kent,
  and they <!-- Page 116 --><span class="pagenum" title="180.png"><a
  name="page116"></a>{116}</span>represent the more or less ordinary South
  English forms of the species. Sometimes the ground colour of the male is
  more distinctly reddish, or rust tinted, and the yellowish bands narrower
  on all the wings. Or the bands may be much broader than in the male
  figured, and the widening is effected by extension in the form of rays
  towards the outer margins of the wings. A form that has been referred to,
  in error, as var. <i>roboris</i>, Shrank (= <i>marginata</i>, Tutt), has
  the outer margins of all the wings broadly yellow. I have not seen an
  English example of this form, but I have a reddish specimen in which the
  yellow band on the fore wings is broader than usual, and the whole of the
  outer third of the hind wings yellow, with a slight brownish shade on the
  external margin; this is <i>semimarginata</i>, Tutt, and is also
  identical with var. <i>roboris</i> of other British authors. The white
  spot usually present on the fore wings varies somewhat in size and shape;
  it is often seen on the under as well as the upper surface of the wings,
  except in the lighter coloured forms.</p>

  <p>Var. <i>callunæ</i> (The Northern Eggar), is shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate54">54</a>. The chief features of this form are the generally
  darker coloration in both sexes, the yellow patch at the base of the fore
  wings of the male, and the outward turn of the lower ends of the yellow
  bands. All these characters are subject to modification; the yellow bands
  may be very narrow at one extreme, or greatly widened at the other, and
  the hind wings may occasionally be bandless; the basal patch is often of
  large size, but in some examples it is entirely absent. Sometimes the
  bands are greenish in colour (var. <i>olivaceo-fasciata</i>, Cockerell),
  and more rarely, perhaps, the greenish tinge extends over the whole of
  the wings (ab. <i>olivacea</i>, Tutt). It should be noted here that the
  var. <i>olivaceo-fasciata</i> has occurred once or twice in South
  England, but this phase of aberration seems to be more connected with
  <i>callunæ</i> than with <i>quercus</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Callunæ</i> was not recognized as British until the year 1847, when
  it was introduced as a species distinct from <i>quercus</i>. The late
  Richard Weaver, who gave it the English name of the "Scotch Eggar," took
  specimens of the moth at Rannoch in 1845, and he found caterpillars in
  that year, as well as in 1844 and 1846. It is now well known to occur not
  only in Scotland, including the Hebrides and Orkneys, but also on the
  moors of Northern England, and in Ireland and Wales. In North Devonshire
  it is found not uncommonly in the Exmoor district, and it has been
  recorded from various parts of the New Forest in Hants.</p>

  <p>The egg of <i>callunæ</i> is figured on Plate <a
  href="#plate55">55</a>. It appears rather polished, and in colour is pale
  brown mottled with darker brown. The eggs are stated to be deposited
  whilst the female is on the wing, and consequently they fall to the
  ground or are arrested in their descent by the herbage over which they
  are scattered.</p>

  <p>The full-grown caterpillar of <i>quercus</i>, beneath the brownish fur
  with which the body is clothed, is dark brown on the back and rather
  violet brown on the sides; the ring divisions are velvety black; there is
  a white stripe along each side and below the stripe some reddish marks;
  the ring nearest the head is edged with reddish, and the next two rings
  each have two reddish centred white spots. The dull purplish brown
  chrysalis is enclosed in a hard oval-shaped cocoon which is spun up on or
  near the ground in a flimsy web among herbage, dead leaves, etc.
  Sometimes it is placed among the twigs of the food plant.</p>

  <p>In Southern England the caterpillars hatch from the egg in August and
  usually hibernate when quite small. They feed up during the following
  spring and early summer, perhaps in June or July, and the moth appears in
  July or August. Occasionally, however, a few individuals depart from the
  general habit and complete their growth the same year, hibernate in the
  pupal stage, and produce moths the next year, possibly earlier than
  hibernating caterpillars. On the other hand, perhaps owing to adverse
  weather conditions, feeding after hibernation may be continued well on
  into the autumn, when the caterpillars pupate, <!-- Page 118 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="184.png"><a name="page118"></a>{118}</span>but
  emergence of the moth is postponed until the following year, the second
  after hatching from the egg.</p>

  <p>In the case of <i>callunæ</i>, at least as regards its normal habit in
  Scotland and southwards to the moorland districts of Yorkshire and
  Lancashire, the young caterpillar hibernates the first winter, feeds
  through the following summer, and passes the second winter as a
  chrysalis, the moth emerging in the following May or June.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, then, it may be stated that <i>quercus</i> has a
  twelve-month life cycle, whilst that of <i>callunæ</i> extends almost or
  quite to twenty-four months, of which at least twelve months are passed
  as a caterpillar. However, as has been noted, <i>quercus</i> sometimes
  passes one winter as a caterpillar, and another as a chrysalis, thus
  assuming the <i>callunæ</i> habit; whilst <i>callunæ</i> occasionally
  attains the perfect state during the summer following that in which the
  caterpillar left the egg.</p>

  <p>The food plants comprise bramble, dogwood, hawthorn, heather
  (<i>Calluna</i>), and various low plants; it is even content with
  ivy.</p>

  <p>Newman, in the <i>Entomologist</i> for 1845, gives a life history of
  the Northern Eggar (<i>callunæ</i>), and from this the following details
  are extracted. The male flies rapidly over the heather by day at the
  latter end of May or beginning of June; its flight is jerking or zigzag,
  and its object is evidently to find the female, who rarely moves until
  impregnation has taken place. Subsequently the female flies over the
  heather, dropping her eggs at random as she flies, and the eggs, having
  no glutinous covering, do not adhere to any object which they may
  accidentally touch in falling. On emergence from the egg the young
  caterpillar is dark ash-coloured, the divisions between the rings of the
  body being indicated by two minute orange streaks, each of which is
  accompanied by a small black spot. After the first moult the ground
  colour becomes more smoky, the divisions velvety black, and on each ring
  a triangular orange spot appears; these markings become more conspicuous
  later on, and by the end of October, when it hibernates, they are very
  distinct. It rests in a straight position, and, if disturbed, falls off
  its food plant, and rolls in a ring with its head slightly on one
  side.</p>

  <p>The habits of the Oak Eggar moths (<i>quercus</i>) are pretty much the
  same as those of the Northern form, except that the moths fly in July and
  August, and frequent hedgerows, the borders of woods, heathy commons, and
  cliffs and sand dunes at the seaside.</p>

  <p>A bred female of either form will attract numerous males, and even the
  receptacle in which a newly emerged female has been placed is almost as
  effective as the lady herself. When staying at a cottage on the edge of a
  moor near Lynton, North Devon, some years ago, I had some pupæ of the Oak
  Eggar. One day, late in July, quite a number of males entered the cottage
  and made their way to the cage in which the pupæ were, and I had no
  difficulty in boxing several of them. The next day I put the female moth,
  which had emerged the previous day, into a roomy chip box, and carried it
  in a satchel to the moor, where it was placed on the ground, the males
  began to arrive soon afterwards and some fine examples were secured.
  Although the female was taken on the moor only on the one occasion, that
  satchel continued to be an object of interest to the male Eggars for
  several days afterwards.</p>

  <p>Generally distributed, and often common in some localities, throughout
  the British Isles. Abroad, its range extends over Europe into Asia Minor,
  Armenia, and Siberia.</p>

<h5><b>The Grass Eggar</b> (<i>Lasiocampa trifolii</i>).</h5>

  <p>This moth is usually brown in colour. The fore wings are inclined to
  dark reddish brown, and have a pale ochreous brown curved band or ring at
  the base, a slightly curved line or band of the same colour beyond the
  middle of the wing; central spot <!-- Page 120 --><span class="pagenum" title="188.png"
  ><a name="page120"></a>{120}</span>white, finely margined in black.
  Except that the female is generally larger, and the cross lines usually
  less distinct, the sexes are much alike. This brown form occurs most
  frequently in Britain, but in parts of the Kentish and Sussex coast, and
  especially the Romney Marsh district, a yellowish form is obtained. In
  such specimens the cross lines are darker. In both forms one or both
  cross markings may be faint or quite absent, and even the white central
  dot, which varies in size and shape, may be missing. Sometimes the outer
  band is distinctly broad and outwardly diffuse (Plate <a
  href="#plate56">56</a>).</p>

  <p>The eggs, which appear to be laid loosely, are pale whitish brown,
  roughened with darker brown, and the micropylar area is purplish brown.
  Some that I received on March 2, 1907, appeared to be on the point of
  hatching on the 5th of that month, but no larva came out, although one of
  the eggs was chipped at one end. It has been frequently stated that the
  caterpillars hatch out in the autumn and hibernate, but as has been
  pointed out by Tutt ("Nat. Hist. Brit. Lep.," ii. 20), the eggs of this
  species probably do not hatch until some time during February or March,
  although when kept indoors the caterpillar has emerged from the egg in
  January.</p>

  <p>The full-grown caterpillar is black, velvety between the rings,
  covered with golden brown hair on the back and greyer hair on the sides,
  among which are some black ones; three interrupted whitish lines on the
  back; some of the hairs along the middle of the back stand erect and form
  a ridge, looked at from either end. Head lightish brown in colour, lined
  with black. Feeds in the spring months and up to June chiefly on various
  kinds of grass. Among many of the plants that it has been known to eat
  are trefoils, bird's-foot (<i>Ornithopus</i>), sea thrift
  (<i>Statice</i>), heather, sallow, hawthorn, sloe, plum, bramble, etc.
  With regard to the food, it is interesting to note that although one
  rearer will find that sallow is excellent for the caterpillars, another
  considers that sallow or hawthorn are but poor <!-- Page 121 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="189.png"><a
  name="page121"></a>{121}</span>substitutes for kidney-vetch (<i>Anthyllis
  vulneraria</i>) upon which the caterpillars were feeding when found
  (Plate <a href="#plate57">57</a>).</p>

  <p>The brownish chrysalis is enclosed in a hard but somewhat brittle,
  brown, oval cocoon, and when spun upon the surface of the ground,
  protected by an outside covering of loose silk webbing. In August and
  early September the moths appear. Emergence from the chrysalis usually
  takes place soon after midday; the males are early on the wing, and when
  reared in captivity they should be secured as soon as the wings are dry,
  or they may spoil themselves in their efforts to escape. Reared females
  are apt to be deformed, but for "assembling" they may probably be as
  useful as more perfect examples if the rearer happens to be able to
  exhibit the attraction in a locality for the species. Both sexes have
  been taken at electric light.</p>

  <p>The best known localities for the species in England are, besides
  those already mentioned, the sand hills on the Cheshire and Lancashire
  coast. It is, or has been, found also on the coast of Cumberland;
  Lyndhurst and Ringwood, in Hampshire; Isle of Purbeck, Poole, Swanage,
  and Bloxworth, in Dorsetshire; Devonport, Bolt Head, and Salcombe, in
  Devonshire; and Penzance and the Scilly Isles. Its range extends through
  Central and Southern Europe to Asia Minor and North Africa.</p>

<h5><b>The Fox Moth</b> (<i>Macrothylacia rubi</i>).</h5>

  <p>The male is reddish brown, and the female generally greyish brown, but
  sometimes is of a reddish grey coloration; the fore wings in both sexes
  are crossed by two pale ochreous lines on the central area (Plate <a
  href="#plate59">59</a>).</p>

  <p>The ground colour in the male ranges in tone from foxy red to dullish
  red brown or to greyish red brown. The cross lines in either sex may be
  widely apart, near together, or even united throughout their length,
  forming a band (var. <i>fasciata</i>, Tutt); sometimes one of the lines
  (var. <i>unilinea</i>, Tutt), or both lines, are absent from the fore
  wings, or from one of them. <!-- Page 122 --><span class="pagenum" title="190.png"
  ><a name="page122"></a>{122}</span></p>

  <p>The brown clouded greyish eggs are laid in batches, during June, on
  stems and stalks of plants, or on heather; sometimes they have been found
  on a fence, a rock, or a stone. The caterpillars hatch out at the end of
  June and through July. At first they are black, including the glossy
  head, and covered with long hairs which are black with some white ones
  amongst them; the ring divisions are pale yellow; later on they are more
  chocolate brown with yellow bands which, however, do not encircle the
  body entirely.</p>

  <p>When full grown, in the autumn, the caterpillar is velvety black, and
  above this colour is most in evidence between the rings; the back is
  clothed with dense, short, bright reddish brown or tawny hair, and the
  whole body is covered with brownish hairs, varying in length, but always
  much longer than the tawny ones; along each side are some whitish hairs.
  Head blackish covered with brownish hairs. It feeds in August and onwards
  to October, when it seeks winter quarters, reappearing in the following
  spring, but not feeding again. After enjoying the sunshine whenever the
  opportunity offers through the early months of the year, it finally
  pupates in March or April. The cocoon is a long, more or less tubular,
  brownish construction of silk and larval hairs. It is spun up, usually
  somewhat upright, low down among the food plant, or at the roots of
  grass, etc.; sometimes among moss, when the rounded head end can just be
  seen above the moss (Plate <a href="#plate58">58</a>).</p>

  <p>In certain localities and seasons the caterpillars have been seen in
  enormous numbers, but such profusion only happens now and then. In some
  districts they may be abundant one year, and then scarce or quite absent
  for several years.</p>

  <p>When handling the larvæ it will often be noted that the tips of one's
  fingers are thickly felted with the tawny hairs from the creature's back;
  if these hairs get transferred to the face or neck considerable
  irritation may be the result.</p>

  <p>The late Mr. Robson used to collect the caterpillars on fine days in
  early spring, put each caterpillar into a separate paper box about two
  inches square, and keep them on a shelf over the kitchen fire, where they
  would duly pupate. Various methods for keeping these caterpillars through
  the winter have been described, and all appear to have been fairly
  successful. The most simple would seem to be the following: Bore a number
  of holes in the bottom of a roomy box, and fasten wire gauze on a close
  fitting frame to serve as a top. Cut a tuft or two of heather to cover
  the floor space of the box. Caterpillars collected in the autumn may be
  put into this receptacle and supplied with food, such as bramble or
  sallow, as long as they seem inclined to feed. Do not crowd too many into
  the box, and let it stand out in the garden, preferably on the soil.</p>

  <p>The moths emerge in May or June. The males are very active on the wing
  in the afternoon sunshine, and later on, and may often be seen in numbers
  dashing hither and thither in an apparently erratic flight over heaths
  and open spaces, in search of the females. The latter do not fly till
  night, and occasionally they are attracted to a bright light.</p>

  <p>Except that it has not been noted in the Shetlands, the species occurs
  throughout the British Isles. Abroad its range extends over Europe, and
  it is found in Amurland.</p>

<h5><b>The Drinker</b> (<i>Cosmotriche potatoria</i>).</h5>

  <p>The male is reddish brown, more or less clouded on the forewings with
  ochreous; and the female is yellow, or whitish ochreous. Sometimes this
  colour distinction of the sexes is reversed, and the males are pale
  whilst the females are dark. In the fens of Cambridgeshire notably, pale
  or yellowish males are not altogether uncommon. Such specimens would seem
  to accord better with the Linnean type than the more usual form indicated
  above. Barrett mentions, among other aberrations, male specimens from
  South Wales with the whole of the fore and hind wings deep rich glossy
  purplish chocolate. <!-- Page 124 --><span class="pagenum" title="194.png"
  ><a name="page124"></a>{124}</span></p>

  <p>There is variation in the two whitish or silvery marks on the fore
  wings, the upper one is often very small, sometimes quite absent, and the
  lower one reduced to a crescent. The chocolate brown cross lines, of
  which there are usually two on the fore wings, are sometimes faint or
  entirely missing. Tutt has recently named nine forms, chiefly colour
  aberrations, and two others were previously named. (The moth is figured
  on Plate <a href="#plate61">61</a>, and the early stages on Plate <a
  href="#plate60">60</a>.)</p>

  <p>The eggs, which are white with bluish grey markings, are laid in
  clusters on grass stems, etc.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is slaty grey inclining to blackish; the lines on the
  back are formed of yellowish dots and dashes; two rows of tufts of short
  black hairs on the back, with longer brown hairs between; low down on the
  sides are shaggy tufts of white and yellowish hairs and longer brown
  hairs; an erect pointed tuft of brown hair on second ring, and a similar
  one on ring eleven but the latter inclines backward. Head greyish,
  striped and lined with brown and yellowish brown, and clothed with brown
  hair. It feeds on coarse grasses, including the ribbon grass grown in
  gardens, in August to September or October.</p>

  <p>In the latter month it goes into hibernation, being then but little
  over an inch in length. About April it resumes feeding and becomes full
  grown in June or thereabouts. The long yellowish or whitish brown cocoon
  in which it changes to a brown chrysalis is more or less pointed at the
  lower end, and generally attached to a culm of grass or a reed. A showery
  season seems to suit these caterpillars better than a hot, dry one. The
  partiality of the caterpillar for a drop of dew, mountain or otherwise,
  has frequently been noted. The old English name of The Drinker
  Caterpillar (1682) is therefore not only an appropriate one but shows
  that this larval habit was observed even at that early date. The specific
  name <i>potatoria</i> given to the moth by Linné is of similar
  significance.</p>

  <p>The moth emerges in July. It seems most addicted to damp grassy lanes,
  ditch-sides, fens, marshes, moorlands, and sandhills; and is not really
  uncommon in very many suitable districts throughout the United Kingdom.
  Abroad, it is common over the greater part of Europe and its range
  extends to Amurland and Japan.</p>

<h5><b>The Small Lappet</b> (<i>Epicnaptera ilicifolia</i>).</h5>

  <p>This exceedingly local and rare British moth has the fore wings pale
  reddish-brown, suffused on the outer marginal area with grey; about the
  centre of the wings there is a short black line preceded by a whitish
  mark; beyond is a blackish, indistinct, wavy line; the greyish outer area
  is limited by a brown line, and this is inwardly edged with whitish: hind
  wings purplish brown with the central area whitish and crossed by a
  blackish line. Fringes whitish, marked with brown at the ends of the
  veins (Plate <a href="#plate63">63</a>).</p>

  <p>Kirby states that the caterpillar is rust coloured, with a black
  stripe on the back, on which stand white dots; and with reddish-yellow
  transverse spots on the second and third rings. Another form is grey, and
  the back white, with a broad black central stripe interrupted by
  rust-coloured spots dotted with black.</p>

  <p>The following brief description is taken from an inflated skin of an
  immature caterpillar received from Dresden: brownish inclining to
  reddish, paler between the rings; clothed with short greyish hair, and
  longer hairs from and above the fleshy tubercles low down along the
  sides; there is a hair-clothed eminence on ring eleven. The only
  conspicuous markings are on rings two and three; each of these has two
  orange spots separated and narrowly edged externally with velvety black;
  there are two small black spots on the back of each of the other rings,
  and indications of reddish circles around some of these. Head blackish,
  covered with greyish hairs (Plate <a href="#plate62">62</a>). <!-- Page
  126 --><span class="pagenum" title="198.png"><a
  name="page126"></a>{126}</span></p>

  <p>In this country the caterpillar feeds on bilberry (<i>Vaccinium
  myrtillus</i>), but on the Continent it is said to eat the foliage of
  sallows and willows, also of birch.</p>

  <p>The cocoon is spun up among the leaves of the food plant. That figured
  on Plate <a href="#plate62">62</a>, of foreign origin, was on a shoot of
  bilberry; a moth emerged from it on April 5, 1907. The first detailed
  account of this species in Britain is that in the <i>Zoologist</i> for
  1852, in which Mr. Atkinson records that he took a specimen in May, 1851,
  at Cannock Chase in Staffordshire. A year earlier two larvæ were found by
  Mr. Green on a moor near Sheffield, and one of these attained the moth
  state in April, 1851. After this moths and caterpillars seem to have been
  taken in varying numbers down to 1896, when a specimen was captured by
  Dr. R. Freer of Rugby. Tutt, quoting from a letter received from Dr.
  Freer, states that two moths were reared from three caterpillars found at
  Cannock in 1898. The only other known British locality is in the
  neighbourhood of Lynton, North Devon, where a caterpillar, which, from
  the description, must have been this species, was found in 1864. It was
  taken on August 3 in a wood abounding with bilberry.</p>

  <p>The species ranges over Central Europe, but seems to be generally
  rare; it also occurs in Amurland and Japan.</p>

<h5><b>The Lappet</b> (<i>Gastropacha quercifolia</i>).</h5>

  <p>Warm reddish brown is the prevailing colour of this fine moth. The
  wings are more or less suffused with purplish grey, and crossed by
  blackish lines&mdash;three on the fore wings and two on the hind wings.
  Except in the reddish tinge, which may be bright or dull approaching
  chocolate, this species is pretty constant in its coloration. Barrett
  mentions a specimen of a light brown colour, and another of a pale buff.
  The first of these forms seems to approach the var. <i>meridionalis</i>,
  Staudinger (Tutt), and the other to var. <i>ulmifolia</i>, Heuäcker,
  which are well known on the Continent. In certain favourable seasons a
  second generation of the moth has been obtained, chiefly perhaps, in
  confinement, and on the Continent; although in Britain a caterpillar or
  two will sometimes feed up and attain the perfect state the same year
  they hatch from the egg. These examples, which are much smaller, but do
  not otherwise differ from normal specimens, are referable to var.
  <i>hoegei</i>, Heuäcker.</p>

  <p>The moth is figured on Plate <a href="#plate63">63</a>, and the eggs
  and caterpillar on Plate <a href="#plate62">62</a>.</p>

  <p>The eggs, which are whitish in colour with greyish markings, are laid,
  in July or early August, in twos, threes, or more, on twigs or the
  undersides of leaves of sloe, apple, sallow, hawthorn, etc. A single
  female moth has been known to lay over a thousand eggs, but this is
  perhaps exceptional, and somewhere about half that number is possibly
  near the average. Even the latter would take the moth some time to
  distribute here and there in small batches.</p>

  <p>The caterpillars hatch out in about a fortnight, feed for a few weeks,
  and in the autumn, when about three-quarters to one inch in length, take
  up their winter quarters low down on the stems of the food plant, but, in
  confinement, often on a withered leaf.</p>

  <p>Caterpillar dark grey, so thickly sprinkled with minute black dots as
  to appear almost black; the whole body is clothed with fine and rather
  short blackish hair; low down on the side there is a fringe of brownish
  hair, and this covers the fleshy lappets (the older writers named this
  larva the "Caterpillar with the Lappets"); two white marks edged in front
  with black on the third ring, and a hairy prominence on the eleventh, are
  the most conspicuous features of this caterpillar. When the front rings
  are extended, the divisions between them are seen to be deep blue. Head
  grey, with darker stripe and paler lines. Occasionally several white
  marks appear on the back, and this is stated by Professor Poulton to
  occur more especially in the caterpillars when the twigs and stems of the
  food plant upon <!-- Page 128 --><span class="pagenum" title="202.png"><a
  name="page128"></a>{128}</span>which they have grown up are covered with
  grey lichen. Sometimes the caterpillar has been reported as destructive
  in orchards; two or three large ones feeding on a small apple tree would
  certainly afford evidence of their presence in the shape of denuded
  twigs, but it is doubtful if they ever occur in sufficient numbers to
  cause any very serious damage to fruit trees.</p>

  <p>The chrysalis is dark brown, inclining to blackish, and covered with a
  whitish powder, which does not shake off. It is enclosed in a long,
  grey-brown, tight-fitting cocoon of silk and hairs of the caterpillar,
  which is generally spun up among the lower twigs, or to the stem of the
  food plant.</p>

  <p>The moth emerges in June or July, and is on the wing at night, when it
  may be sometimes netted as it flies along or over hedgerows. When caught
  in this way it dashes about so wildly in the net that it is rarely of
  much value for the collection. The same may be said of examples taken by
  light, which at times attracts the moths freely. When resting in the
  daytime, it very closely resembles a withered bramble-leaf or bunch of
  leaves. The fore wings are folded down, roof-like, over the hind wings,
  which are flattened out and their edges project beyond the margins of the
  fore wings. It is, however, very rarely seen in the open at such
  times.</p>

  <p>The species does not seem to have been recorded from Ireland or from
  Scotland, but it has a wide distribution in England, although much less
  frequently met with in the north than in the south. In the Cambridge fens
  it is perhaps more plentiful than elsewhere, but it is not uncommon in
  some parts of Berkshire, Huntingdonshire, and Kent. The range abroad
  extends through Central, Southern, and Eastern Europe, to Armenia,
  Tartary, Siberia, and Amurland; it is also represented in China, Corea,
  and Japan.</p>

<h5 class="lg125">ENDROMIDIDÆ.</h5>

<h5><b>The Kentish Glory</b> (<i>Endromis versicolor</i>).</h5>

  <p>This species has the fore wings of the male brownish clouded and
  suffused with ochreous; there is a white patch at the base, and some
  white marks including three spots towards the apex, on the outer marginal
  area; two black cross lines, the first inwardly and the second outwardly,
  edged with white; the space between the lines is sometimes clouded with
  whitish, and there is an almost central black <img src="images/mark1.png"
  class="middle" style="height:2ex;" alt="sideways vee" />-shaped mark.
  Hind wings tawny with a black central line, some brownish marks beyond,
  and sometimes two white spots at the upper angle. The female is much
  larger in size, without ochreous suffusion on the fore wings, and the
  hind wings have the ground colour whitish. It varies in the tone of the
  brown colour, and, in the male, in the amount of ochreous suffusion
  (Plate <a href="#plate65">65</a>).</p>

  <p>The eggs are laid in rows, generally two deep, on a birch twig. At
  first they are greenish, but soon change to brownish olive or shining
  purplish brown.</p>

  <p>When young the caterpillars cluster together on the twigs, as shown on
  Plate <a href="#plate64">64</a>. They are at first black with glossy
  dots, and later, greenish, but still dotted with black. After the third
  skin change, they are without the black dots, and the colour is then
  pretty much that of the mature caterpillar, which is green, rather
  whitish on the back, and with a dark green central line; a series of
  seven creamy oblique stripes along the sides, and on the sides of the
  first three rings there is a whitish stripe broken at the divisions;
  these markings are often edged with dark green; on the eleventh ring
  there is a somewhat horn-like prominence, striped with creamy white, and
  below it a yellow stripe; the spiracles are white, ringed with black.
  Head small, paler green, with whitish marks. Feeds on birch, from late
  May to <!-- Page 130 --><span class="pagenum" title="206.png"><a
  name="page130"></a>{130}</span>July. Alder, sallow, and lime have also
  been mentioned as food plants.</p>

  <p>The rough, blackish, or sooty-brown chrysalis is enclosed in a coarse
  netted cocoon, dark brown in colour, and more or less covered with moss,
  leaves, or other material, among which it is spun up, generally on the
  ground, but sometimes just under the surface. Assisted by the points on
  the rings of the body, the chrysalis is able to work itself partly out of
  the cocoon, and this it does some days before the moth emerges.</p>

  <p>The moths usually emerge in late March and in April, earlier or later
  in some seasons. They do not always come up the year after pupation, but
  often remain two or more winters in the chrysalis.</p>

  <p>The males fly in the sunshine, and are very strong on the wing; the
  females are not active until dark. This sex has been found resting on the
  twigs of birch, also on heather, and occasionally on a tree trunk. The
  males "assemble" freely to a freshly emerged female. The species inhabits
  the more open parts of woods and forests, moors and hillsides where
  birches flourish. It is probably more plentiful in its Scottish
  localities, such as Rannoch and Forres, than elsewhere, but it occurs
  also in Aberdeenshire, Kincardineshire, and Argyllshire. In England it
  seems to be not uncommon in Wyre Forest, Worcestershire, and the Reading
  district in Berkshire. It used to be so plentiful in Tilgate Forest,
  Sussex, that over a hundred males were brought to the net in one day by a
  bred female put down to allure them. This happened some fifty years ago,
  and compares curiously with a record of one male attracted by a female in
  Tilgate Forest, April 13, 1869. Other localities in Sussex that have been
  mentioned are St. Leonard's Forest and near Petersfield; it has also been
  found in Herefordshire and in some parts of Suffolk. Distributed over
  Central and Northern Europe, the range extending to North Italy.</p>

<h5 class="lg125">SATURNIIDÆ.</h5>

<h5><b>The Emperor Moth</b> (<i>Saturnia pavonia</i>).</h5>

  <p>In a general way the fore wings of the male may be described as
  purplish grey, suffused with rosy or with tawny shades; a reddish cloud,
  black marked above, at the tips of the wings; the outer margins are more
  or less whitish, and there is a whitish patch about the middle of each
  wing, in which is an eyed spot; the hind wings are tawny, with a central
  eye spot and a blackish band towards the outer margin. The female has all
  the wings pale purplish grey, with whitish bordered outer margins;
  markings much as in the male, but the central area of the hindwings is
  more or less whitish. There is some variation in the ornamentation;
  occasionally the white markings are of large size, or, on the other hand,
  may be almost or quite obscured. Very rarely the eye-spots are absent
  from all the wings (ab. <i>obsoleta</i>, Tutt), and sometimes they are of
  abnormal shape. Now and then specimens of the female sex are dark in
  colour, with red bands, and Barrett mentions an example of this sex smoky
  black in colour, with still blacker markings (Plate <a
  href="#plate66">66</a>).</p>

  <p>The olive brown, clouded greyish eggs are laid in neatly arranged
  batches around the stems or twigs of plants; I once found a batch in
  North Devon on a loose piece of rock. The caterpillar when full grown is
  bright green, with black markings; the warts from which blackish bristles
  arise are yellow, sometimes pink or blackish. In an early stage it is
  black, with an orange line low down along the sides; later on it is still
  black, but ringed with orange. It feeds in June, July, and August on many
  kinds of plants, among which may be mentioned heather, bramble, sallow,
  sloe; also meadow-sweet (<i>Spiræa ulmaria</i>) and purple loose-strife
  (<i>Lythrum salicaria</i>).</p>

  <p>The curious cocoon formed by the caterpillar (Plate <a
  href="#plate67">67</a>) is <!-- Page 132 --><span class="pagenum" title="210.png"
  ><a name="page132"></a>{132}</span>so constructed at the narrow end that
  the moth on emergence can easily pass through; after the insect's escape,
  the converging fibres forming the "door" spring to again, and the point
  of exit looks pretty much as before the moth had pushed through. This
  kind of opening can only be worked from the inside, therefore enemies
  from without are unable to effect an entrance.</p>

  <p>The moths are out in April and May, and the males may be seen on sunny
  days flying at a great pace over heaths, moorlands, and mosses, also
  about the borders of woods. The female flies at night, but it may
  occasionally be met with resting on heather or other herbage in the
  daytime. A freshly emerged female moth will, as a rule, attract as many
  specimens of the opposite sex as one would care to take; all that one has
  to do is to take her in a box to some likely spot, and there await the
  coming of the males.</p>

  <p>The species seems to be generally distributed throughout the British
  Isles, but is commoner in some parts than in others, and apparently rare
  in portions of the Midlands.</p>

  <p>The distribution abroad extends through Europe to North Asia Minor and
  Armenia, and to Siberia, Amurland, and Ussuri.</p>

<h5 class="lg125">DREPANIDÆ.</h5>

  <p>The British species belonging to this family, with one exception, have
  the tips of the fore wings pointed and curved downwards, forming a sort
  of hook, hence the English name Hook-tips. The exception is <i>Cilix
  spinula</i>, a round winged moth, not at all like other members of the
  family, but its caterpillar is very like others of the group.</p>

  <p>The bristle and catch arrangement for locking the wings is present in
  all the species, but the tongue or proboscis is absent, or practically
  so. The caterpillars are not furnished with anal <!-- Page 133 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="211.png"><a
  name="page133"></a>{133}</span>claspers, therefore have only fourteen
  legs, that is, six true legs and eight false legs (pro-legs). The last
  ring of the body is more or less tapered, sometimes terminating in a
  point; the back is roughened with raised spots and warts, or humped. They
  feed on the leaves of trees and bushes, usually exposed, and they pupate
  in a silken cocoon, spun up between leaves, or in a folded leaf, of the
  food plant.</p>

  <p>Of the eleven species occurring in the Palæarctic Region, seven are
  European, and six of these are found in the British Isles.</p>

<h5><b>The Pebble Hook-tip</b> (<i>Drepana falcataria</i>).</h5>

  <p>The fore wings are brown, whity brown, or whitish; the central area is
  crossed by three blackish wavy lines, a blackish blotch in the third line
  and two blackish dots between it and the second line; beyond there is a
  dark brown, or reddish-brown curved line from the tip of the wing to the
  inner margin. Hind wings similar in colour to the fore wings, but paler
  on the front area; crossed by five wavy dusky lines, sometimes not well
  marked except on the inner margin; generally, there is a black central
  dot. The paler forms have a dusky shading on each side of the curved line
  on the fore wings.</p>

  <p>The egg is yellow freckled with orange, chiefly at one end.
  Caterpillar green, the back reddish-brown, except towards the
  black-marked yellowish head; two conspicuous warts on rings two to five,
  and less noticeable raised spots on the other rings, all bearing hairs.
  In a younger stage it is blackish, with white marks on the fourth and
  seventh rings; later it becomes greenish below, and the markings on the
  back of rings four, seven, eight, and ten are whitish or creamy. Until
  nearly full grown it usually lives on the underside of a leaf, the edges
  of which are turned over and held down by silken threads; sometimes it
  may be seen on the upper side of a leaf under a slight web. It feeds <!--
  Page 134 --><span class="pagenum" title="212.png"><a
  name="page134"></a>{134}</span>chiefly on birch, but is occasionally
  found on alder, in June and July, and in September and October, and may
  be obtained by searching or by beating, but the former, although perhaps
  slower, is much the better method. The moth is shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate68">68</a>, and the early stages on Plate <a
  href="#plate69">69</a>.</p>

  <p>The species is widely distributed, and seems to occur, sometimes
  commonly, wherever there are birches, especially of bush-like growth, in
  most English counties and also in Scotland. In Ireland it appears to be
  somewhat local and scarce.</p>

<h5><b>The Scarce Hook-tip</b> (<i>Drepana harpagula</i>).</h5>

  <p>The general colour of this species is brownish; the fore wings are
  slightly tinged with ochreous and speckled with minute violet-tinged
  silvery scales; between the first and second brown lines there is an
  irregular ochreous brown mark enclosing yellowish spots; the
  violet-tinted glistening scales are most in evidence on both sides of the
  black mark before the outer margin. Hind wings similar in colour to the
  fore wings; crossed by two brown lines, the second with an ochreous brown
  blotch above it (Plate <a href="#plate68">68</a>).</p>

  <p>Caterpillar, yellow freckled with brown; clouded with brown on first
  three rings; a reddish brown irregular stripe runs along the sides and
  upwards towards middle of the back on rings five, six, eight, and nine; a
  double-pointed hump on the back of ring three, the points tipped with
  yellow. Head notched on the crown, dotted and clouded with brown. It
  feeds on the small-leaved lime (<i>Tilia parvifolia</i>), and may be
  found from July to September and even later. I have not seen a living
  caterpillar of this species; the above short description has been drawn
  from an inflated skin (Plate <a href="#plate69">69</a>).</p>

  <p>The only British locality for this species is the Leigh Woods near
  Bristol, where it was first met with in 1837. It is, however, very rare
  and difficult to obtain. Abroad it ranges through Central Europe to
  Livonia, Southern Sweden, and to Northern Italy. On the Continent the
  caterpillar feeds on the foliage of other trees than lime, and there are
  two broods in the year.</p>

<h5><b>The Oak Hook-tip</b> (<i>Drepana binaria</i>).</h5>

  <p>The male is of an ochreous-tinged brown coloration; all the wings are
  crossed by two slender deep ochreous lines, and have two obliquely set,
  almost central, black dots; outer margin of fore wings often blackish,
  marked towards the tip; the hind wings are deep ochreous on the front
  marginal area. Fore wings of the female paler, and the hind wings
  ochreous yellow; the cross lines on the latter often lost in the ground
  colour (Plate <a href="#plate71">71</a>).</p>

  <p>In freshly emerged male specimens the brown is sometimes purplish
  tinged, and in some examples of the same sex the hind wings may be
  described as ochreous, with brown bands. The female occasionally has the
  fore wings tinged with greyish, and the hind wings are sometimes banded
  with brown, especially on the inner marginal area.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is ochreous brown with a double-pointed hump on ring
  three, a yellowish diamond on the back of rings five to ten; the front
  and hind rings are brown, more or less tinged with purple; yellowish
  lines, shaded below with purplish brown, on the sides meet on the back
  and form an edging to the diamond mark. The figure on Plate <a
  href="#plate70">70</a> shows the caterpillar in its usual resting
  attitude. It feeds on oak.</p>

  <p>A widely distributed species in the southern half of England, but not
  especially abundant in any locality, and not known to occur north of
  Lincoln.</p>

<h5><b>The Barred Hook-tip</b> (<i>Drepana cultraria</i>).</h5>

  <p>Fore wings pale fulvous or ochreous brown, with two paler cross-lines
  on all the wings, space enclosed by the lines darker brown; a black or
  blackish central dot, and before the brownish <!-- Page 136 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="216.png"><a name="page136"></a>{136}</span>outer
  margin there is a pale line ending on the tip of the wing. The hind wings
  have an obscure dusky central dot placed in the upper edge of the band,
  and usually there are two brownish bands on the outer marginal area, but
  these do not extend to the front margin. Except that the female is
  generally larger, and the antennæ are simple, the sexes are much alike
  (Plate <a href="#plate71">71</a>).</p>

  <p>This species is best distinguished from <i>binaria</i> by the dark
  bands, and the straighter second line. The central dots are less
  trustworthy characters, because summer specimens of the present species
  often have two of these spots on the fore wings (var. <i>æstiva</i>,
  Spr.), and in occasional examples of <i>binaria</i> the lower central
  spot of the hind wings is absent. As a rule, however, the central dots
  are more conspicuous in <i>binaria</i> than in <i>cultraria</i>. The egg
  is yellowish, tinged with reddish at the ends and along the sides. The
  caterpillar is somewhat similar to that of the last species, but the hump
  on ring three is smaller, and the side lines and diamond mark are whiter.
  It may be found in June and July, and again in September, and even in
  October in some years. It feeds on beech (Plate <a
  href="#plate70">70</a>).</p>

  <p>This species is found where beech trees occur, preferably on a chalky
  soil, in the counties of England from Norfolk southwards. The male may
  often be seen in May, flying around the beech trees or neighbouring
  bushes, in the sunshine; or both sexes may be caused to leave their
  resting places among the foliage by tapping the boughs.</p>

  <p>Its range extends through Central Europe to Asia Minor.</p>

<h5><b>The Scalloped Hook-tip</b> (<i>Drepana lacertinaria</i>).</h5>

  <p>The name Scallop Hook-tip given to this species by Moses Harris in
  1775, doubtless referred to the ragged outlines of the fore wings. These
  wings are pale brown in colour, freckled and clouded with darker tints,
  and crossed by two dark-brown lines; the central dot is black, but often
  minute; fringes <!-- Page 137 --><span class="pagenum" title="217.png"><a
  name="page137"></a>{137}</span>white, chequered with brown. Sometimes the
  freckling is heavy and the clouding very dark, becoming almost black on
  the outer margin; such specimens seem to be referable to var.
  <i>scincula</i>, Hübn. In another form the fore wings are ochreous brown,
  with very tiny freckling and only light clouds on the upper part of the
  outer margin. The hind wings in all the forms are pale whitish brown,
  with a black central dot, and brown marginal line; in the darker
  specimens these wings are clouded or suffused with dark brown (Plate <a
  href="#plate71">71</a>).</p>

  <p>The egg is pale yellowish when laid, but changes afterwards to
  reddish. The full-grown caterpillar is pale brownish, marked with darker
  or reddish brown on the back and sides, and raised spots; there are
  double-pointed humps on rings two and three, and a similar but smaller
  elevation on ring eleven. In the younger state the caterpillar is
  blackish, with whitish marks on the fourth, seventh, and eighth rings,
  and some white dots on the end rings. It feeds on the upper surface of
  the leaves of birch in June and July, and again in August and
  September.</p>

  <p>Chrysalis, reddish brown, the ring divisions blackish grey; powdered
  with whitish, and appearing as though dusted with flour. Attached by the
  anal spike to the interior of the silken web-like cocoon. In the Figure
  (Plate <a href="#plate69">69</a>) the pupa is shown hanging from the
  ruptured cocoon, upon the covering leaf of which a half-grown caterpillar
  is depicted.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in May and June, and a second generation appears in
  August. It is not uncommon in most birch woods, and on heaths and
  commons, where birch flourishes; but the perfect insect, which rests on
  leaves and twigs of trees and bushes, and the herbage under them, is not
  so frequently or so easily obtained as the caterpillars. The latter may
  be searched for in the daytime, or they may be dislodged by beating.</p>

  <p>Widely distributed throughout England, but local or scarce in
  Lancashire and Yorkshire and northwards; also, according to <!-- Page 138
  --><span class="pagenum" title="218.png"><a
  name="page138"></a>{138}</span>Barrett, in Devonshire and in the fens of
  Norfolk and Cambridge. It occurs in the Clydesdale district, Ross,
  Argyllshire, and Sutherland in Scotland; and in Ireland it seems to be
  widely spread and common in some localities.</p>

<h5><b>The Chinese Character</b> (<i>Cilix glaucata</i>).</h5>

  <p>Probably in reference to the grey-brown oval blotch on the middle of
  the white fore wings, this moth was known to the older entomologists by
  the English name of "Goose-egg." On the blotch, however, there are
  silvery marks on the veins, and below it (often attached) there is a
  blackish blotch with some bluish silvery scales upon it. These markings
  probably suggested to Haworth the name Chinese Character by which it is
  commonly known (Plate <a href="#plate71">71</a>).</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is reddish brown, with a darker line along the back,
  and a paler patch on rings three to five, extending as a narrow stripe to
  the dark-brown spiked tail; two raised warts on rings two and three, with
  a white dot between the hinder pair. Head darker brown, paler in front.
  It feeds in June and early July, and in September and October, chiefly on
  hawthorn and sloe, but it will also eat apple and pear. The chrysalis,
  which is enclosed in a brown, rather tough, silken cocoon, spun up among
  leaves or under loose bark, is greyish on the wing covers, and reddish on
  the body.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in May and early June, and again from late July well
  into August. Sometimes it may be seen resting on a leaf in a hedgerow.
  When disturbed in the daytime, which may happen where one is beating the
  bushes, it falls, rather than flies, to the ground. At night it may be
  netted as it flies along the hedgeside or wood borders in almost every
  county of England and Wales. In Scotland its range seems not to extend
  north of Clydesdale. Kane states that it is "widely spread, but not
  generally at all numerous" in Ireland.</p>

<h5 class="lg125">NOLIDÆ.</h5>

  <p>Some thirteen or fourteen species occurring in Europe are referred by
  Staudinger to this family. Only five of these occur in the British Isles.
  The moths are of rather small size, less, in fact, than some of the
  so-called "Micros," among which they have been placed. Probably they may,
  for this reason, be overlooked. They mostly sit head downwards on the
  trunks, branches, or leaves of trees, sometimes on palings, but the rarer
  ones hide themselves among the thick, low herbage. The time of flight is
  after dark, and the moths occasionally visit the sugar patch. The
  caterpillar has only eight false legs (prolegs), the first pair being the
  absent ones; the body is clothed with tufts of hair, the hairs of the
  front and rear tufts longer than the others. When full grown it spins a
  more or less spindle-shaped, toughish cocoon of silk mixed with the
  larval hairs, which is usually coated with particles scraped from the
  surface of twig or stem upon which it is spun up.</p>

<h5><b>The Short-cloaked Moth</b> (<i>Nola cucullatella</i>).</h5>

  <p>The fore wings are whitish or greyish, with a dark, almost black,
  patch at the base; this patch is marked with whitish, and is limited by
  the first cross line, which is black and curved; the second line, also
  black, is wavy and curved inwards towards the front margin; between these
  lines is a dusky central shade, commencing in a blackish spot on the
  front margin, and sometimes forming an inward border to the second line;
  a raised tuft of white, grey-capped scales on the basal patch, and two
  other tufts beyond it and in a line with the front margin; hind wings
  dark grey, paler towards the base (Plate <a href="#plate73">73</a>).</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is reddish brown, clothed with short greyish hairs;
  the spots and central line on the back are whitish. It <!-- Page 140
  --><span class="pagenum" title="222.png"><a
  name="page140"></a>{140}</span>hatches from the egg early in August, and
  after feeding for a while, retires to winter quarters, selecting some
  sheltered cranny, such as a chink in the tree bark, where it spins over
  itself a few strands of silk. Feeding is resumed in May and June, after
  hibernation, usually on the upperside of leaves of sloe and whitethorn,
  and also of fruit trees, such as apple and plum, and sometimes pear
  (Plate <a href="#plate72">72</a>).</p>

  <p>The moth is out in June and July. It flies at dusk.</p>

  <p>Widely distributed and generally common in the south of England;
  somewhat rare in Scotland&mdash;perhaps overlooked. It has been reported
  from Ireland, but is not mentioned by Kane in his catalogue of Irish
  Lepidoptera.</p>

<h5><b>The Small Black Arches</b> (<i>Nola strigula</i>).</h5>

  <p>Fore wings greyish white, freckled and dusted with grey brown at the
  base and on the front and outer margins; two black wavy and toothed cross
  lines; between the base of the wing and the second line are three raised
  tufts of grey brown tipped whitish scales: hind wings dark grey, paler
  towards the base (Plate <a href="#plate73">73</a>).</p>

  <p>The caterpillar feeds, probably after hibernation, from April to June,
  on the undersides of oak leaves. It is pale ochreous in colour, with pale
  reddish brown warts and star-like tufts of hair; a blackish bar on the
  back of ring six; head blackish.</p>

  <p>The moth emerges from the chrysalis in July. It occurs in oak woods in
  Kent, Surrey, Sussex, Hants, Somerset and Gloucestershire; also in Berks,
  Norfolk, Suffolk, and Essex, but it is very local and seems to be
  restricted to a more or less limited area in all its known haunts, among
  which the most favoured are perhaps the New Forest in Hampshire and
  Abbots Wood in Sussex. In some years it may be fairly common, or even
  plentiful, and then becomes quite scarce during several seasons in the
  same place. <!-- Page 141 --><span class="pagenum" title="223.png"><a
  name="page141"></a>{141}</span></p>

<h5><b>The Least Black Arches</b> (<i>Nola confusalis</i>).</h5>

  <p>Very similar to the last species, but whiter; the first line is curved
  towards the second tuft of raised scales, thence gently curved to the
  inner margin, above which there is a slight inward angle or elbow; the
  second line is less wavy; hind wings whitish grey with a black central
  dot, and in the male whiter along the inner area. The head and palpi of
  this species are white, but <i>strigula</i> has a greyish white head and
  dark palpi. Again, the antennæ in the male of the present species are
  ciliated, but in male <i>strigula</i> they are bipectinated (Plate <a
  href="#plate73">73</a>).</p>

  <p>The caterpillar, which feeds in July and August on the leaves of oak,
  beech, sloe, and apple, etc., is reddish, inclining to yellow on the
  back, which is traversed by black lines, the central double and
  interrupted on rings seven to nine by rusty V-shaped marks.</p>

  <p>The moth flies in May and June.</p>

  <p>This species appears to have a wider distribution than either of the
  others. It is the only one known with certainty to occur in Ireland, and
  it is widely spread in that country. In Scotland it is found in
  Perthshire and Ayrshire, and probably is present in other parts. In
  England it is obtained in most counties, except perhaps the northern,
  although it has been recorded from various parts of Yorkshire.</p>

<h5><b>Kent Black Arches</b> (<i>Nola albula</i>).</h5>

  <p>Fore wings white, largely light brown between the obscure cross lines;
  outer marginal area clouded, and front margin dotted with light brown;
  three tufts of raised scales placed as in previous species; hind wings of
  the male, greyish white, browner on the outer margin; of female, brownish
  grey. Varies in the amount of light brown, and sometimes this is much
  reduced; more rarely it disappears entirely (Plate <a
  href="#plate73">73</a>). <!-- Page 142 --><span class="pagenum" title="224.png"
  ><a name="page142"></a>{142}</span></p>

  <p>The caterpillar varies in colour from ochreous with pink tinge to bone
  white; the warts are set with pale hairs and those along the back and at
  each extremity are longest; a double greyish line along the middle of the
  back, and a series of black marks on each side; these marks unite across
  the back on rings six and ten. After hibernation, it feeds in Spring
  until June, on the young growth of bramble, raspberry, strawberry, and
  cinquefoil (<i>Potentilla reptans</i>), and is stated to also eat hemp
  agrimony (<i>Eupatorium cannabinum</i>). The brownish cocoon is
  constructed on a stem of grass and in appearance looks not unlike a
  swelling of the stem.</p>

  <p>This species was first observed in England in the year 1859, when four
  specimens were taken in July at Chattenden Roughs, a large hilly wood in
  North-east Kent. It still occurs, no doubt, in the Kentish locality
  referred to, but is now very scarce there compared with what it must have
  been some twenty-five years ago. Barrett notes a specimen from the Isle
  of Wight. Mr. G. T. Porritt states that he has seen one of two examples
  captured in South Devon in 1901; and another, a male, has been recorded
  as taken at light in a house near Weymouth, Dorset, in August, 1904, and
  from Lewes in 1906.</p>

  <p>At the time the first specimens were met with in England the species
  seems to have been rare, or little known on the Continent. Since then
  knowledge of its distribution has vastly increased, and it has now been
  found not only in many parts of Central Europe, but also in Finland,
  Italy, Dalmatia; Asia Minor, Persia, and extending into Amurland and
  Japan.</p>

<h5><b>The Scarce Black Arches</b> (<i>Nola centonalis</i>).</h5>

  <p>The general colour of this moth is white; the fore wings more or less
  sprinkled and clouded with brownish grey or dark grey, and crossed by two
  black lines, the first curved and the second slightly waved, indented and
  edged inwardly with ochreous brown; the three raised tufts are white,
  capped with grey (Plate <a href="#plate73">73</a>).</p>

  <p>This is the only really variable species among the five occurring in
  this country. In some specimens the space between the cross lines is
  largely filled in with dark grey, and in other specimens the wings are
  almost entirely white, traces of the cross lines being the only
  markings.</p>

  <p>Mr. Robert Adkin, who has reared this species from the egg, kindly
  allowed me to select specimens from his fine series to illustrate the
  range of aberration; these are figured on Plate <a
  href="#plate73">73</a>.</p>

  <p>Caterpillar brownish inclining to purplish, with an ochreous line
  along the middle of the back and some brown V-shaped black marks. Head
  blackish brown. It feeds in May, after hibernation, on various clovers,
  preferring the blossoms, and bird's-foot trefoil (<i>Lotus
  corniculatus</i>).</p>

  <p>The moth appears some time between mid-July and mid-August. The late
  Mr. Tugwell, by keeping some larvæ, reared from the egg, in a warm room
  induced them to feed up instead of hibernating, and they attained the
  moth state in December.</p>

  <p>This is another exceedingly local species in England. It was first
  taken at Bembridge in the Isle of Wight in 1858, and one or two specimens
  have since been obtained in that island. Examples have also occurred on
  the cliffs near Hastings, and at Folkestone; and one has been recorded as
  taken in a light trap at Woodbridge in Suffolk, July 21, 1904. The
  headquarters for the species in this country are the Deal sand-hills, on
  the Kentish coast, where it was discovered over a quarter of a century
  ago, and probably occurs still.</p>

<h5 class="lg125">CHLÖEPHORIDÆ.</h5>

  <p>Authors are not at all agreed as to the systematic position of this
  family, and there seems to be some difference of opinion as to the
  species that properly belong to it. Sir George Hampson <!-- Page 144
  --><span class="pagenum" title="228.png"><a
  name="page144"></a>{144}</span>has transferred the group to the Noctuidæ
  and separated <i>S. revayana</i> from the others, placing it in his
  sub-family Sarrothripinæ, to which also belong certain Indian
  species.</p>

  <p>Only four species occur in our islands. Three of these have green fore
  wings and pale grey or whitish hind wings. The other species,
  <i>Sarrothripa revayana</i>, has the fore wings of various shades of
  grey, brown, or blackish; its boat-shaped cocoon is very like a small
  edition of that of <i>Hylophila bicolorana</i>, and, although the
  caterpillar is in some respects not very dissimilar to those of the
  green-winged species, the moth does not seem quite to be one of their
  set.</p>

<h5><b>The Cream-bordered Green Pea</b> (<i>Earias chlorana</i>).</h5>

  <p>In size, colour of the fore wings, and general appearance this moth
  might be mistaken for the much more common Green Tortrix (<i>Tortrix
  viridana</i>). On examination however, it will be seen to have white hind
  wings, whilst those of the <i>Tortrix</i> are grey. Again, the head,
  front of thorax, and front edge of the fore wings are white in the
  present species (Plate <a href="#plate73">73</a>).</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is green, inclining to whitish on the back, the latter
  lined with brownish, and bearing warts on rings six and eleven. It feeds
  in July and August on the terminal leaves of osier and willow; these
  leaves are drawn together with silk, and the solid appearance of the
  foliage at the end of the twig will afford a clue to the probable
  whereabouts of the caterpillar when one is searching for it. Chrysalis,
  brown, darker on the back, paler on the under parts, and on the wing
  covers; enclosed in a tough boat-shaped cocoon which is often constructed
  on the bark of a twig or stem of the food plant. As a rule the moth does
  not emerge until the following year, but in some years a few will appear
  in the autumn, and others remain in the chrysalis until the following May
  or June.</p>

  <p>This species inhabits damp places where there are osiers, <!-- Page
  145 --><span class="pagenum" title="229.png"><a
  name="page145"></a>{145}</span>and it is especially common in the fens.
  It occurs in most of the southern and eastern counties of England, but
  does not seem to be recorded from other parts of the British Isles.</p>

<h5><b>Green Silver Lines</b> (<i>Hylophila prasinana</i>).</h5>

  <p>The bright green fore wings are crossed by two shaded silvery lines,
  and a narrow silvery band, the latter running from the tip of the wing to
  the inner margin, and usually there is a whitish shade between the two
  lines; the fringes are reddish, or pinkish, and the front and inner
  margins are tinged with the same colour, sometimes strongly so on the
  inner margin. The hind wings of the male are whitish, tinged with
  yellowish green; fringes white, more or less tinted with reddish; in the
  female the hind wings are entirely silky white. Antennæ reddish (Plate <a
  href="#plate73">73</a>).</p>

  <p>Caterpillar, green, with yellowish dots, lines on the back, and edging
  to first ring of the body; the anal claspers are marked above with red.
  It feeds in August and September on the leaves of oak, birch, beech and
  nut (Plate <a href="#plate72">72</a>).</p>

  <p>The chrysalis is purplish above merging into pale brown beneath;
  wing-cases ochreous brown; the dorsal surface, especially the ring
  divisions, are dusted with whitish dots. It is enclosed in a papery
  cocoon of a pale pinky brown colour; frequently spun up on the back of a
  leaf, but also in a curled leaf, bark chink, or among herbage and litter
  on the ground.</p>

  <p>The moth flies in June and July, and is not uncommon in woods
  throughout the greater part of England, it may be beaten from trees, and
  is often to be seen sitting on bracken and other undergrowth. It is also
  found in Scotland up to Moray, and seems to be pretty generally
  distributed in Ireland. The range of this species abroad extends through
  Northern and Central Europe, South Russia, Siberia, to Japan. <!-- Page
  146 --><span class="pagenum" title="230.png"><a
  name="page146"></a>{146}</span></p>

<h5><b>Scarce Silver Lines</b> (<i>Hylophila bicolorana</i>).</h5>

  <p>The green colour of the fore wings of this moth is rather paler than
  of those of the last species; they are crossed by two almost parallel
  yellowish lines; hind wings white and silky. Antennæ whitish towards the
  tip and reddish towards the base (Plate <a href="#plate73">73</a>).</p>

  <p>Caterpillar green, sometimes tinged with yellow, a dark line along the
  middle of the back is edged on each side with whitish.</p>

  <p>The chrysalis is pale greenish, with a narrow black stripe from the
  head along the thorax extending to the fourth abdominal ring; the wing
  cases reach the sixth ring, which together with the back of the fifth are
  roughened with fine blackish points.</p>

  <p>Cocoon boat-shaped with the keel raised at the head end. When the moth
  emerges from this end the cocoon closes up tightly again, so that no
  opening is to be seen; slight pressure on the back will cause the exit
  slit to open.</p>

  <p>This rather local species is perhaps commoner in the eastern counties
  of England than elsewhere, but it occurs in the oak woods of Berkshire,
  and southward to Kent and Hampshire. Much scarcer in the west and
  midlands, and apparently unknown in the north. Barrett gives Galway and
  Queen's County in Ireland, but adds that it is rare.</p>

  <p>Distributed over Central and Southern Europe, and its range extends to
  South Sweden, and Asia Minor.</p>

<h5 class="lg125">SARROTHRIPINÆ.</h5>

<h5><b>The Large Marbled Tortrix</b> (<i>Sarrothripa revayana</i>).</h5>

  <p>This is a most variable species, ranging from greyish white through
  various shades of brown to blackish; the grey and the <!-- Page 147
  --><span class="pagenum" title="231.png"><a
  name="page147"></a>{147}</span>brown forms are sometimes tinged with
  green. In the illustration some of the more usual forms of marking are
  shown. 1 (more or less typical) and 2 are the most common; 5
  (<i>ramosana</i>) is less frequently met with; 4 (<i>ilicanus</i>) has
  ashy brown fore wings with a black bar at the base, three black dots on
  the disc, and a series of black dots before the outer margin, the
  triangular marking on the front margin is reddish; 3 is a modification of
  the typical form approaching var. <i>dilutana</i>; 6 is of the
  <i>afzelianus</i> form, with shiny brownish fore wings and black
  markings.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:47%;">
      <a href="images/fig23.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig23.jpg"
      alt="Fig. 23." title="Fig. 23." /></a>
    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig. 23.</span></p>

    <p style="text-align:center"><b>Large Marbled Tortrix.</b></p>
  </div>

  <p>The caterpillar is green with whiter ring divisions; a few long
  whitish hairs on each segment; a faintly darker line along the back, and
  a paler interrupted line along the sides. Head yellowish green marked
  with brownish and sparsely clothed with whitish hairs. It feeds in June
  and July on the leaves of oak and sometimes on sallow. It spins a whitish
  boat-shaped cocoon on the under side of an oak leaf or twig, and therein
  turns to a pale green chrysalis with a broad purple brown stripe along
  the back from the head; the blunt last ring is tinged with purplish brown
  and the edge of the ring immediately before it is fringed with minute
  hooks (Plate <a href="#plate72">72</a>, Figs. 4, 4<i>a</i>).</p>

  <p>The moth seems to be out from August to April. It may be <!-- Page 148
  --><span class="pagenum" title="232.png"><a
  name="page148"></a>{148}</span>beaten from trees and bushes throughout
  the autumn, and during the later months of the year it seems to hide in
  yews and hollies. Just before dusk it becomes active and may then be
  netted as it flies; later on it may be seen regaling itself on overripe
  blackberries, or on the ivy blossom, and it is not an infrequent visitor
  to the sugar patch.</p>

  <p>The species has been found in almost every part of England and Wales
  wherever there are oak woods. In Scotland it occurs up to Argyllshire and
  Moray. For Ireland, Kane gives Tyrone, Westmeath, Galway, Kerry, and
  Limerick.</p>

  <p>Distribution abroad: Central and Southern Europe, extending northwards
  to Scandinavia, and eastwards to Amurland and Japan.</p>

<h5 class="lg125">ARCTIIDÆ.</h5>

  <p>In this family Staudinger includes 161 species known to occur in the
  Palæarctic Region. About forty of these are found in Europe, and
  thirty-one of the latter rank as British species.</p>

  <p>The family is usually divided into two sub-families&mdash;Arctiinæ and
  Lithosiinæ, fifteen of our species being referred to the former and
  sixteen to the latter. In both groups the caterpillars are hairy, but the
  hairs are usually longer in those of the "Tigers" than in those of the
  "Footmen"; the latter, too, are lichen feeders, whilst the others prefer
  the foliage of plants.</p>

<h5><b>Tiger Moths</b> (<i>Arctiinæ</i>).</h5>

  <p>The moths in this sub-family have short, or, rather, stout bodies, and
  ample wings; and as the tongue is imperfectly developed in most of the
  species, flowers have not the same attraction for them as for the
  long-winged and slender-bodied Lithosiinæ, most members of which have
  this organ well developed.</p>

<h5><b>The White Ermine</b> (<i>Spilosoma menthastri</i>).</h5>

  <p>Older English names for this generally distributed and often common
  species are The Great Ermine Moth of Wilkes (1773), Harris (1778), and
  The Large Ermine of Haworth.</p>

  <p>On Plate <a href="#plate75">75</a> will be found three colour-forms of
  the moth. Fig. 1 has the typical whitish colour, Fig. 2 is creamy on the
  fore wings, and Fig. 3 has the fore wings buff. The last represents a
  specimen from Scotland, where, especially in the western parts of the
  country, and also in the north of Ireland, and the north-west of England,
  buff forms, both paler and much darker than the one figured, are not
  uncommon. Sometimes the Scottish specimens have smoky hind wings. As
  regards the black spots on the wings, the species is subject to
  considerable variation. In some examples almost all the markings are
  entirely absent; in others they are very small and numerous, or large in
  size and number; the central spots on the fore wings are often united,
  forming irregular designs. Again, there may be an unusual amount of black
  spotting on the outer margins, and all other parts of the wings free of
  spots. All these aberrations in marking, except, perhaps, the central
  cluster, seem to occur in the various colour forms. An uncommon form,
  known as var. <i>walkeri</i>, Curtis (Plate <a href="#plate78">78</a>,
  Fig. 5), has the black scales gathered together into streaks along the
  nervures of the fore wings; modifications of this variety have also been
  found, or reared. Possibly by the careful selection of parent moths
  showing tendency to the streaked aberration it might happen in a
  generation or two that var. <i>walkeri</i> would turn up in the breeding
  cage to reward the rearer for trouble taken in the experiment.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar, which is often not uncommon in gardens in August and
  September, or even later, is brown, with long hairs, and a reddish stripe
  along the middle of the back. It feeds on <!-- Page 150 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="236.png"><a name="page150"></a>{150}</span>the
  foliage of low-growing plants, and does not appear to be specially
  attached to any particular kind. The chrysalis is dark brown, in a
  close-fitting cocoon of silk and hair from the caterpillar, spun up in
  odd corners on the ground or at the base of a wall or fence, sometimes
  between the pales (Plate <a href="#plate74">74</a>).</p>

  <p>The moth emerges in June, and may be seen sitting on walls, fences,
  trees, or on the herbage growing on hedge banks; or even on the bare
  ground. It often flies into houses when lighted up, and is a frequent
  attendant at the public gas lamps and electric lights. The geographical
  range of this species extends through Northern and Central Europe
  southward to North-West Africa, and eastward to Amurland.</p>

<h5><b>The Water Ermine</b> (<i>Spilosoma urticæ</i>).</h5>

  <p>The specimens of this white moth, depicted on Plate <a
  href="#plate75">75</a>, are of the form usually met with in Britain. To
  Haworth, Stephens, and other early entomologists this was known by the
  English name of the "Water Ermine" (<i>S. papyrata</i>, Marsham), whilst
  a rarer form&mdash;with a minute dot on the disc of the fore wings, and
  three dusky spots on the hind wings, as in the White Ermine&mdash;was the
  "Dingy White" of Haworth. Occasionally specimens are obtained with extra
  black spots on the basal and front areas of the fore wings.</p>

  <p>Caterpillar, dark brown with a purplish tinge, the hairs, arising in
  spreading tufts from black warts, are dark brownish; spiracles white;
  head black and glossy. Feeds in July and August on a variety of marsh
  plants, among which are yellow loosestrife (<i>Lysimachia vulgaris</i>),
  mint (<i>Mentha aquatica</i>), lousewort (<i>Pedicularis</i>), water dock
  (<i>Rumex hydrolapathum</i>), and iris. It seems to affect plants growing
  under bushes, rather than those more exposed. It is, presumably, not
  difficult to rear in confinement, as there is a record of eight broods
  belonging to three generations, and all descendants of a captured female,
  having been reared by Mr. Bacot. Chrysalis dark reddish brown, in a
  cocoon similar to that of the last species.</p>

  <p>The moth, which emerges in June, is rarely seen away from its
  favourite haunts, which are marshes and fens; its English name is
  therefore a very appropriate one. It is not often observed in the
  daytime, but is on the wing early in the evening, and later on is pretty
  sure to be attracted to any strong light that may be set up in its
  neighbourhood. The best localities for the species seem to be the fens of
  Norfolk and Cambridge, but it used to be fairly plentiful in many
  suitable parts of East Kent, and no doubt still occurs in some of the
  marshes between Dartford and Gravesend: it is found in Sussex in the
  Lewes and Brighton districts, and has been recorded from Kimmeridge in
  Dorsetshire, from the Isle of Wight, from near Burton-on-Trent, from the
  Lancaster district, and from Pembrokeshire, South Wales. In Scotland it
  is rare, and, with the exception of one example reported as taken in an
  illuminated moth trap at Clonbrock, May, 1896, not known to occur in
  Ireland.</p>

  <p>The distribution abroad extends over Central and Northern Europe,
  through South Russia to Amurland.</p>

<h5><b>The Buff Ermine</b> (<i>Spilosoma lubricipeda</i>).</h5>

  <p>This species is now known by the English name of the Buff Ermine, but
  the names bestowed upon it by some ancient writers were perhaps hardly
  more suitable. Thus Wilkes in 1773 called it the "Spotted Buff Moth," and
  Harris five years later dubbed it the "Cream-dot Stripe." The ground
  colour is generally some shade of buff, in the paler specimens merging
  into cream, and in the darker to yellowish ochre. In the matter of black
  marking the range of variation is extensive. The specimens figured on
  Plate <a href="#plate77">77</a> illustrate something of this variation,
  both as regards colouring and marking. The females are, as a rule, paler
  than the males, but occasionally examples <!-- Page 152 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="240.png"><a name="page152"></a>{152}</span>of the
  latter sex are quite as pale as any female. Figures 7 and 8 represent
  var. <i>zatima</i>, Cramer. Originally this form was only known to occur
  in Heligoland. The same form, or a modification of it, was described by
  Haworth as <i>radiata</i>, from a Yorkshire specimen. Then, in 1837,
  specimens of the variety were reared with the normal form of the species
  from caterpillars obtained at Saltfleet in Lincolnshire; and subsequently
  a few more examples were reported from the last named county, and
  elsewhere. In 1891 a specimen of var. <i>zatima</i> emerged from an
  assortment of chrysalids sent to Mr. Harrison of Barnsley from a London
  correspondent. This particular specimen was of the female sex, and it
  paired with a male which was also an aberration, but not of the
  <i>zatima</i> form. Some of the offspring resulting from this union were
  of the female parent form, others favoured the male parent, and others
  again were intermediate. In the course of a few generations almost entire
  broods of the <i>zatima</i> variety were obtained. Allowing the sexes of
  <i>zatima</i> to mate with those of more or less ordinary
  <i>lubricipeda</i>, the late Mr. W. H. Tugwell obtained many very
  interesting aberrations, one of which he named var. <i>eboraci</i>, and
  another <i>fasciata</i>. The <i>zatima</i> form and its various
  modifications have now been reared by entomologists all over the country,
  and presumably directly or indirectly from the original Barnsley stock.
  In Yorkshire especially the race has been improved; the specimens are
  larger and darker, and there is a tendency towards the almost entirely
  black form known as var. <i>deschangei</i>.</p>

  <p>The pale whitish green eggs are laid in batches on leaves, sometimes
  high up on birch trees, or virginia creeper, but more usually on the
  foliage of low growing plants; it is often common in gardens. At first
  the caterpillar is tinged with yellowish, but it afterwards becomes
  greyish, and finally brownish. When full grown the hairs, with which the
  body is clothed, are brown; there is a yellowish or whitish grey stripe
  along each side, and an obscure somewhat reddish <!-- Page 153 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="241.png"><a name="page153"></a>{153}</span>tinted
  line down the middle of the back. Head glossy brown.</p>

  <p>The glossy reddish-brown chrysalis is enclosed in a dingy coloured
  web-like cocoon, which is spun up among leaves or litter on the ground.
  Mr. R. Adkin found some of these cocoons spun up between the folds of an
  old brown blanket used as a covering for a rabbit hutch in winter. The
  moth emerges in June. Occasionally, in confinement, specimens will leave
  the chrysalis in the autumn instead of passing the winter therein, as
  they more usually do (Plate <a href="#plate76">76</a>).</p>

  <p>A common and often abundant species over the greater part of the
  British Isles. Its range abroad extends through Central and Northern
  Europe, South Russia, and Tartary to Amurland, Corea, and West China.</p>

<h5><b>The Muslin</b> (<i>Diaphora mendica</i>).</h5>

  <p>The early British authors knew this moth as the "Spotted Muslin" or
  "Seven Spot Ermine" (Harris, 1778). The male is dark brown or blackish,
  with a few usually obscure black dots on each wing. The female is silky
  white, with more clearly defined, and often more numerous, black dots
  (Plate <a href="#plate75">75</a>, Figs. 4-6). On Plate <a
  href="#plate78">78</a> will be found figures of the rarer and more
  extreme aberrations of the female. Those represented by Figs. 3, 4, 6, 7,
  were reared some years ago by Mr. G. T. Porritt, of Huddersfield, who at
  the same time obtained a number of other interesting intermediate
  examples ("Trans. Ent. Soc. Lond.," 1889, p. 441, Pl. 14). Variation in
  the other direction is towards the complete suppression of the black
  dots; and I have seen specimens with only one such dot on each wing.</p>

  <p>In the var. <i>rustica</i>, shown on the same plate, it will be noted
  that the males assimilate somewhat to the female coloration; the
  specimens (Figs. 1, 2), were bred by Mr. Robert Adkin in 1887. This form
  was not known to occur in the British <!-- Page 154 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="242.png"><a name="page154"></a>{154}</span>Isles
  until 1885, when Mr. de V. Kane detected specimens in a collection of
  insects made in Co. Cork, Ireland. It was next heard of from Belfast, and
  then, in 1886, again, in Co. Cork, an example of each sex was taken. The
  female specimen laid eggs, and some of these were sent to Mr. Adkin, who
  not only was successful in rearing the moths, but in 1889 obtained a
  pairing between an almost white male <i>rustica</i> and an ordinary
  English female. Only four eggs were laid, and from these two male moths
  resulted in May, 1890, both intermediate in colour between the two forms.
  In all its early stages <i>rustica</i> is identical with ordinary
  <i>mendica</i>.</p>

  <p>Male specimens with pale yellowish grey coloured wings have been
  reared from eggs laid by a female captured at Eltham, Kent, exhibiting a
  tendency to the <i>rustica</i> form. In the Barnsley district, Yorkshire,
  the males are paler than usual, but in the Sheffield area of the same
  county the males are black. From North Durham chrysalids, I have a smoky
  greyish form of the male.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is brownish grey covered with yellowish brown hairs
  arising from greyish-ringed pale brown warts; a paler line along the
  middle of the back, and some white dots forming a broken line below the
  black outlined spiracles. Head pale chestnut brown, glossy. When newly
  hatched it is whitish, tinged with yellow and semi-transparent; the dots
  and hairs are dark grey. After the first moult the colour is greyish with
  black dots and blackish hairs. Head yellowish, brown tinged. It feeds in
  July, sometimes earlier, and August, and seems to thrive on the foliage
  of many kinds of low-growing plants, such as dandelion, dock, plantain,
  chickweed, etc., and also eats the leaves of birch and rose. Chrysalis,
  very dark brown, almost black, glossy, but minutely pitted, giving a
  roughened appearance; enclosed in a close fitting cocoon composed of silk
  and the caterpillar's hairs, with particles of earth on the outside
  (Plate <a href="#plate79">79</a>). The moth flies at night, and except
  that a female may occasionally be seen on the wing, this species is
  rarely observed in the daytime. May and June are the usual months for
  this moth, but in 1906 a specimen was attracted to light on November
  3.</p>

  <p>Widely distributed, and often common in most English counties, in
  parts of Wales, and in Scotland as far north at least as Ross. In Ireland
  one male specimen of the typical form has been obtained in Co. Galway,
  and one in Co. Clare; var. <i>rustica</i> occurs in Co. Dublin, and Kings
  Co., Waterford, Cork, Kerry, and Galway.</p>

<h5><b>The Ruby Tiger</b> (<i>Phragmatobia fuliginosa</i>).</h5>

  <p>The English name given to this moth only suitably applies to the
  southern reddish form of the species (Plate <a href="#plate80">80</a>,
  Fig. 1 &#x2642;). In the north of England the fore wings are darkened
  with brownish and the hind wings with blackish tints, until in Scotland
  the only trace of red colour is found on the inner edge of the hind wings
  (var. <i>borealis</i>, Staudinger, Fig. 2 &#x2640;). In these dark
  specimens the body is also blackish. Very occasionally, specimens
  approaching the northern form are obtained in South England. A female
  moth captured by Mr. G. E. J. Crallan in May, 1901, at Bournemouth, laid
  forty-eight eggs; thirty imagines were bred the same year, two of which
  were <i>borealis</i>. On the south and south-west coasts the black band
  of the hind wings exhibit a tendency to break up into spots; not
  infrequently this is completely effected, and the specimens then approach
  the larger South European form var. <i>fervida</i>, Staud. In a fine
  series of this species from Cornwall, lately seen in Mr. A. Harrison's
  collection, are a few specimens that come very close to the last-named
  form. A yellow aberration has been recorded. The eggs are whitish and
  deposited in batches on leaves. Up to the last moult the caterpillar is
  greyish or brownish, with dark greyish or blackish <!-- Page 156 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="246.png"><a name="page156"></a>{156}</span>warts
  from which arise star-like tufts of brown hairs; a reddish line along the
  middle of the back, and some reddish spots on the sides. When full grown
  it is black, and the reddish line on the back is almost hidden by closer
  and more compact tufts of black hairs. Head black and glossy.</p>

  <p>The leaves of various low-growing plants afford it nourishment, but it
  is very partial to dock, dandelion, golden-rod (<i>Solidago</i>), and
  plantain; it is also fond of groundsel and lettuce in confinement, but
  these plants have been found unsuitable if given too frequently. In the
  open it seems to feed through the summer, hibernate when full grown,
  reappear in the early spring, and in due course spin its brownish cocoon
  among herbage generally low down near the ground; on moors it often makes
  the cocoon among the twigs of heather as shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate81">81</a>. The chrysalis is black, marked with yellowish on
  the hind edge of each ring. The vitality of the caterpillar is
  extraordinary. One known to have been embedded in ice for fourteen days
  at least, became active in less than half an hour after the ice around it
  melted. It pupated shortly afterwards.</p>

  <p>When eggs are obtained early, it is possible to have three generations
  of the moth during the same year. Thus eggs deposited on May 8 produced
  caterpillars which fed up quickly and attained the moth state in July.
  From July eggs some of the caterpillars will outstrip their companions,
  pupate in September, and appear as moths about a month later. The moth is
  to be found in May and June, sometimes in July or August, in wood
  clearings, on moors and rough hillsides, and also in water meadows, etc.
  It flies at night, is attracted by light, and although it occasionally
  flies in the sunshine, it is, as a rule, not often seen in the daytime.
  Occurs throughout the British Isles to the Orkneys. Distribution: Europe,
  Western and Central Asia, Amurland, Japan, North-west Africa, North
  America.</p>

<h5><b>The Wood Tiger</b> (<i>Parasemia plantaginis</i>).</h5>

  <p>On Plate <a href="#plate80">80</a> are shown some of the forms of this
  attractive and somewhat variable species. Figs. 3, 4, are male and female
  of the typical form found in England. The most usual phase of variation
  is in the narrowing or widening of the pale yellowish markings of the
  fore wings, and the black markings on the hind wings; occasionally the
  yellow or the black increases to such an extent that the fore wings
  appear to be almost entirely of the one colour or the other. The hind
  wings range in colour from the normal yellow through orange to red, and
  through pale shades of yellow to white; on the other hand they are
  sometimes almost entirely black. The var. <i>hospita</i>, Schiff. (Fig.
  7), has all the wings white, and although it has been reported from
  Shropshire, West Durham, the Lake District, etc., it has been chiefly
  obtained in the Hebrides and in the highlands of Scotland. Only males of
  this form are known; the females found with them have heavy black
  markings on the hind wings, almost crowding out the reddish ground
  colour. The creamy markings of the fore wings are narrow, and the central
  spot small.</p>

  <p>The full-grown caterpillar is blackish above with greyish-black warts
  from which arise tufts of blackish hairs, except on rings four to six,
  where the hairs and the warts at the base of each tuft are reddish; the
  black hairs of the hinder tufts are the longest (Plate <a
  href="#plate81">81</a>).</p>

  <p>Twelve eggs laid by a female in Aberdeenshire were received on June
  29, 1906. They were shining yellowish in colour, and were on a leaf of
  plantain. The caterpillars resulting from these eggs were reared on a
  mixed diet of forget-me-not (<i>Myosotis</i>), plantain, and groundsel,
  but evinced a decided preference for the former. Some died young in
  moulting, but at the beginning of August five were full grown, and four
  duly pupated in a slight but roomy cocoon of silk, mixed with the
  caterpillar's hairs, <!-- Page 158 --><span class="pagenum" title="250.png"
  ><a name="page158"></a>{158}</span>in which the blackish brown chrysalis
  with the cast-off skin attached to the tail was plainly visible. Four
  moths, all female, emerged at the end of August, when the other
  caterpillar was still feeding, and seemingly about mature. That
  caterpillar did not, however, pupate, or survive the winter. As a rule
  the caterpillars hibernate when about half grown, and feed up in April
  and May of the following year. The somewhat unusual rate at which those
  just mentioned completed their growth was no doubt due to the heat of the
  summer of 1906.</p>

  <p>The moth is to be found on heaths, moors, the slopes of chalk, and
  limestone hills; also in woods that are not too thickly timbered and have
  a good undergrowth of heather, etc. The males may sometimes be seen
  flying in the sunshine, and they will then be noted to wing their way to
  some particular spot where most likely a freshly emerged female will be
  the attraction. The male is often started up from the heather or other
  herbage as one walks along; or it may even rise from the bare ground upon
  which it sometimes has a fancy to sit. The female seems to be more
  sluggish during the daytime.</p>

  <p>The species is widely distributed over the British Isles, and its
  range extends through Central and Northern Europe, and Northern Asia to
  Japan.</p>

<h5><b>The Clouded Buff</b> (<i>Diacrisia sanio</i>).</h5>

  <p>Fore wings of the male yellow, with a reddish and greyish central
  mark; hind wings whitish, with blackish central spot and outer band; the
  inner margin, fringes, and front edge light crimson. The female has
  orange fore wings with reddish margins, veins, and central mark; hind
  wings orange, with black basal area, central spot, and outer band (Plate
  <a href="#plate82">82</a>).</p>

  <p>The female of this species is so different in appearance from the male
  that it was described by Linnæus as distinct, under the name
  <i>russula</i>. In the tenth edition of "Systema Naturæ" it is <!-- Page
  159 --><span class="pagenum" title="251.png"><a
  name="page159"></a>{159}</span>No. 510, whereas <i>sanio</i>, the male,
  is No. 506. We must, therefore, in accordance with the law of priority,
  adopt the earliest name for the species, however much we regret having to
  discard the old familiar name of <i>russula</i>.</p>

  <p>Although the central spot of the fore wings is subject to minor
  modification in size, shape, and colour, it is in the hind wings that
  variation chiefly occurs. In the male the blackish grey band on the outer
  area of the hind wing may be broad and complete, or it may be broken up
  by the veins into a series of bars; then, again, the bars tend to become
  smaller and smaller until only tiny portions remain. Usually, the basal
  third of the hind wings is more or less greyish, but sometimes the whole
  surface almost, or quite up to the outer band, is clouded with dark grey.
  The black markings of the female hind wings are apt to vary in a very
  similar way.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is reddish brown, covered with brown hairs; a
  yellow-marked whitish stripe along the back, and two darkish stripes on
  the sides; a white spot below each black margined spiracle. It hatches
  from the egg in July, and as a rule hibernates when still small,
  completing growth in April and May. It feeds on the leaves of many low
  plants, among which are dandelion, dock, chickweed, and plantain. The
  chrysalis is brown, streaked with greyish, and is enclosed in a flimsy
  cocoon among herbage, generally on the ground.</p>

  <p>The moth, which inhabits heaths and mosses, is on the wing in June and
  early July; the male may be put up on sunny days, but the female is not
  often seen until early evening. After dark both sexes may be found on the
  heather.</p>

  <p>It should be noted here that there are usually two broods of this
  species abroad, and that in confinement it will develop a more or less
  complete second brood in September with us. An instance is recorded of
  sixty-three out of sixty-six caterpillars from eggs laid in early July,
  feeding up and producing moths in the last week of September. The
  caterpillar is not an easy one <!-- Page 160 --><span class="pagenum" title="252.png"
  ><a name="page160"></a>{160}</span>to deal with during hibernation, so
  that it would always be to the advantage of the rearer to get it through
  to the perfect state the same year, whenever possible.</p>

  <p>The species is widely distributed over the south and east of England,
  and South Wales. It occurs in Cheshire in all suitable places; in
  Lancashire it is common on the moorlands, as at Witherslack and Methop,
  and it is not uncommon near Quernmore, Clougha, and other places, in
  July. Local and somewhat scarce as a rule in Yorkshire, but recorded as
  not uncommon in the Scarborough district. In Scotland it is found in
  Roxburghshire, and northwards to Aberdeen; and, according to Kane, it is
  widely spread, although local, in Ireland.</p>

<h5><b>The Garden Tiger</b> (<i>Arctia caia</i>).</h5>

  <p>How frequently the collector has had introduced to his notice, by some
  non-entomological friend, or worthy cottage dame, a "fine butterfly,"
  only to find that the supposed prize, usually imprisoned under an
  inverted tumbler, was just an ordinary specimen of the gaudy, but common,
  Garden Tiger. Few persons living in the country, and at all interested in
  the natural objects around them, will fail to recognize the portraits on
  Plate <a href="#plate82">82</a>; other figures, however, on Plate <a
  href="#plate84">84</a> will appear strange, and yet they only portray
  some of the many forms which the moths assume. Possibly it would be true
  to say that no two specimens could be found that were exactly identical
  in tint and marking. Even the markings of any one example are frequently
  not precisely alike on corresponding wings. Normally the fore wings are
  white or creamy-white with dark brown markings, and the hind wings are
  red with deep blue centred black spots, often ringed with yellow. The
  dark markings of the fore wings are most inconstant in size and in form;
  in some cases they are so greatly enlarged that these wings might be
  described as dark brown with narrow, irregular whitish markings (Plate <a
  href="#plate84">84</a>, Fig. 1). On the other hand, but less frequently
  perhaps, the dark markings are narrowed, shortened, and reduced in
  number, until only spots remain on a white or creamy ground (Plate <a
  href="#plate84">84</a>, Fig. 2). The red colour of the hind wings is
  sometimes crimson in tone, or it assumes an orange tint, and less often
  it gives place to yellow; the central spots often unite and form a band,
  or some, occasionally all, disappear; the marginal spots sometimes run
  into a band.</p>

  <p>Besides aberration, such as that referred to above, curious abnormal
  specimens occur in the breeding cage from time to time, but these are
  often more or less deformed. It is, perhaps, remarkable, that so few
  "good things" in the way of varieties are obtained from collected
  caterpillars, even when these are reared by hundreds. Possibly, if the
  breeder started operations with a stock of eggs from unusually pale or
  unusually dark females, and then reserving only the lightest or the
  darkest, as required, of each generation to continue the experiment, some
  interesting light or dark "strains" might result in course of time. The
  objection to this is that before the desired result was obtained the
  stock might be weakened by "inbreeding," and the moths consequently
  deformed. If, however, the same line of experiment were conducted by
  several people, each living in a different part of the country, and with
  stock selected from the products of his own locality, eggs, caterpillars,
  or chrysalids might be exchanged, say, after the second year, and in this
  way the effect of "inbreeding" would be minimized.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar, generally known as the "Woolly Bear," is not at all
  an uncommon object throughout the country, and is, perhaps, even more
  often noticed in gardens, including those of suburban London. The figures
  of the early stages of this moth, on Plate <a href="#plate85">85</a>, are
  all from material obtained in my own small garden. <!-- Page 162 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="256.png"><a name="page162"></a>{162}</span></p>

  <p>The foliage of pretty well all low plants, and tall ones, such as the
  hollyhock and sunflower, too, seem to be equally acceptable to this
  larva. It is not often seen before hibernation, but in the early days of
  spring it will be noticed sunning itself on walls and fences that have a
  good crop of nettles, dock, or other weeds at their base or around them;
  or it may be searched for on the undersides of dock, etc. Mr. Frohawk
  records these caterpillars as swarming from mid-May to mid-June, 1904, in
  the Scilly Isles. He states that they occurred in such myriads that no
  vegetation escaped them, and that they devoured anything from stonecrop
  to the foliage of shrubs of various kinds. Every path and roadway was
  dotted all over with their crushed bodies.</p>

  <p>In the open the moth is on the wing in July and sometimes in August.
  When kept indoors the caterpillars, or at least some of them, will feed
  up quickly and attain the moth state in September or October.</p>

  <p>The species is distributed over the whole of Europe, except Andalusia,
  Sicily, and the southern part of the Balkan Peninsula, and its range
  extends through Asia to Amurland, Corea, and Japan.</p>

<h5><b>The Cream-spot Tiger</b> (<i>Arctia villica</i>).</h5>

  <p>Although this moth does not vary to the same extent as its cousin the
  Garden Tiger, it is still subject to considerable aberration in the size,
  number, and position of the yellowish-white, or cream-coloured spots on
  the fore wings and of the black spots and hind marginal markings of the
  hind wings. The former are often much reduced in size, rarely perhaps so
  greatly as to leave the fore wings almost entirely black; but they are
  sometimes so greatly enlarged and united that these wings appear to be
  cream coloured with black markings. On the hind wings the black spots
  nearest the base are sometimes widened and lengthened so as to meet and
  form a transverse band; in other specimens the black markings on the
  outer area are run together into a patch. Occasionally both forms of hind
  wing aberration occur in the same specimen. I am not aware of any case in
  which the hind wings are spotless, but I have seen specimens in which
  this condition was very closely approached. Very rarely the hind wings
  are suffused with black, and at least two specimens with all the wings
  suffused with black have been recorded. (Plate <a href="#plate87">87</a>,
  Figs. 1-3.)</p>

  <p>The pearly white eggs are laid in neatly arranged batches on leaves.
  The caterpillars hatch out in July, feed for a few weeks, and go into
  hibernation while still small. They resume feeding in a favourable season
  as early as mid-March. Some that I obtained at the end of March, then
  about three parts grown, began to spin up on April 15. The full-grown
  caterpillar is black with several star-like clusters of brown hairs on
  each ring, the hairs on the back of the hinder rings rather longer and
  slightly curved backwards; the head, legs, and claspers are red,
  approaching crimson. A diet of dandelion suits it very well, but it will
  also eat chickweed, dock, nettle, groundsel, and in fact almost any
  low-growing plant. The outer leaves of lettuce are useful on occasion but
  should not be given exclusively, and it also likes the tender shoots of
  gorse (<i>Ulex europæus</i>). Chrysalis and cocoon somewhat similar to
  those of the last species (Plate <a href="#plate86">86</a>).</p>

  <p>The moth emerges in May and June. Occasionally a few larvæ will feed
  up and the moths appear the same year, but this only happens in captivity
  and not in the open. When reposing in the daytime, on a hedgebank for
  example, with the fore wings closed down over and hiding the yellow hind
  wings this moth is not so conspicuous as one might suppose it would be.
  At night it is active on the wing and often flies into houses, attracted
  by the light. I have put up specimens now and then <!-- Page 164 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="260.png"><a name="page164"></a>{164}</span>in hay
  fields, and once found half a dozen along a short stretch of the Upper
  cliff at Ventnor, Isle of Wight.</p>

  <p>It is perhaps most frequent in the south-west, but the species seems
  to be widely distributed and fairly common from Kent to Cornwall, and
  westward from Hampshire to Gloucestershire. It also occurs in the eastern
  counties to Cambridge and Norfolk. From Cheshire it has been twice
  reported, and two specimens are said to have been taken, a few years ago,
  in the Lancaster district.</p>

<h5><b>The Jersey Tiger</b> (<i>Callimorpha quadripunctaria</i>).</h5>

  <p>This handsome species long known as <i>C. hera</i>, Linn., but for
  which Poda's earlier name <i>quadripunctaria</i> must be adopted, has its
  English home in South Devonshire. The species had been recorded as
  British as far back as 1855, when one moth was taken at Newhaven in
  Sussex; in 1859 a specimen was obtained in North Wales, two were taken in
  Sussex, 1868, and one was captured in the Isle of Wight in 1877. The
  last-mentioned example was kindly presented to me by the captor, Mr.
  Rowland Brown. For the county of Devon, the earliest record is that of a
  specimen netted in a garden at Alphington, near Exeter, in 1871, followed
  soon after by a report of others at a place near Lodderwell. Ten or
  eleven years later the moth was found at Dawlish, and in that
  neighbourhood and in other parts of a wide area stretching from Exeter to
  Teignmouth, and perhaps further west, it has been taken almost every year
  up to the present time (1907). Large numbers of eggs have been obtained
  and distributed among entomologists, many of whom have successfully
  wintered the caterpillars and eventually reared the moths.</p>

  <p>The principal variation is in the colour of the hind wings and the
  body, which usually are red, but in var. <i>lutescens</i>, Staud., are
  yellow; between the red and the yellow forms there are all kinds of
  orange and other intergrades. There is also variation in the black
  markings at the inner angle of the fore wings, some or all of which are
  sometimes absent. A specimen with the inner margin of the fore wings
  black instead of creamy-white has been recorded, and a specimen with
  whitish hind wings is stated to have been seen but not secured. The moth
  is shown on Plate <a href="#plate89">89</a>, and the early stages on
  Plate <a href="#plate88">88</a>.</p>

  <p>The eggs, which are laid in batches, are pale yellowish when
  deposited, but assume a deep violet tint before hatching. Mr. W. Hewett
  (<i>Entom.</i> xxviii.) states that in the case of seventeen female moths
  that he captured in August, 1895, the average number of eggs laid by each
  was 133, and as regards fourteen batches of eggs, the caterpillars
  hatched out in fifteen or sixteen days.</p>

  <p>When nearly full grown the caterpillar is blackish with an orange
  stripe along the back and a series of creamy white spots on the sides;
  the hairs, arising from shining light brown warts, are pale brown mixed
  with greyish ones; spiracles black ringed with white, under surface
  greyish. Head black and glossy. It hatches from the egg in the autumn and
  goes into hibernation while still very small; reappearing in the spring
  and feeding on until July, when it spins a flimsy silken web-like cocoon
  well down among moss and litter. The food plants are dandelion, white
  deadnettle (<i>Lamium album</i>), ground ivy (<i>Nepeta glechoma</i>),
  groundsel, plantain, nettle, borage (<i>Borago officinalis</i>), and
  lettuce.</p>

  <p>The moth emerges in July and August in a state of nature, but often as
  early as June in confinement. It sits by day among the herbage, and in
  the bushes of hedgerows, but readily quits its retreat when disturbed.
  The normal time of flight is at night; and that light has an attraction
  for the moths is evident from the fact that they have been known to fly
  into cottages at the rate of three or four in an evening.</p>

  <p>The species is distributed throughout Southern Europe, its <!-- Page
  166 --><span class="pagenum" title="264.png"><a
  name="page166"></a>{166}</span>range extending to Holland, Belgium, and
  Livonia. It was known as an inhabitant of the Channel Islands long before
  it became established in England.</p>

<h5><b>The Scarlet Tiger</b> (<i>Callimorpha dominula</i>).</h5>

  <p>Except in minor details this tropical-looking moth (Plate <a
  href="#plate89">89</a>) seems little given to variation in England. In
  parts of Central and Southern Europe, and Asia Minor, striking forms
  occur, and some of these are very occasionally found with us. Among such
  rare aberrations in this country are var. <i>rossica</i>, Kol., with
  yellow hind wings; and var. <i>bithynica</i>, Staud., with the spots on
  the fore wings yellow, and the hind wings of the normal crimson colour. A
  South European form, var. <i>persona</i>, Hübn., has the hind wings and
  body black, with some yellow marks on the basal area; spots on the fore
  wings smaller than in the type. Specimens approaching this form have been
  reported from Kent, which county is also noted for "black
  <i>dominula</i>." In the latter variety the hind wings, body, and spots
  on fore wings are blackish; it is exceedingly rare. A specimen taken at
  St. Margaret's Bay, Kent, some years back has the spots on the fore wings
  blurred, due to a cloudy suffusion filling up the space between them; the
  spots on the hind wings are pale.</p>

  <p>Caterpillar, black, hairy, with bands of more or less connected spots,
  yellow or yellowish in colour, down the middle of the back, and along the
  sides; the hairs, arising from shining black warts, are grey with some
  black ones intermixed. Head, glossy black. It hatches from the egg in
  July or August, feeds for awhile, then hibernates, and completes its
  growth in April or May. A number of plants have been mentioned as
  suitable food for these caterpillars, but the favourites are, perhaps,
  nettle, groundsel, hound's-tongue (<i>Cynoglossum officinale</i>),
  bramble, sloe, and sallow (Plate <a href="#plate88">88</a>).</p>

  <p>The chrysalis is dark reddish, rather blacker above; enclosed in a
  silken cocoon spun up among leaves, etc., on the ground.</p>

  <p>The moth emerges in June, and seems partial to marshy ground. It is
  found in the district between Dover and Deal commonly, and in other parts
  of Kent more rarely. Also in Hampshire, Devon, Dorset, South Wales,
  Gloucestershire, Wiltshire, Berkshire (water meadows by the Kennet), and
  Hertfordshire (rare). Some years ago I found a few specimens in the
  Brandon district, but it is not plentiful in Suffolk, and is rare in or
  absent from Norfolk. It is found in Cambridgeshire, chiefly in Wicken
  fen.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Note.</span>&mdash;Although <i>Callimorpha</i> is
  here left in its old position among Arctiidæ, the genus has been referred
  by Hampson to Hypsidæ, a family of moths belonging to the African,
  Oriental, and Australian regions. Our two species are the sole
  representatives of the family in Europe.</p>

<h5><b>The Feathered Footman</b> (<i>Coscinia striata</i>).</h5>

  <p>Altogether there do not appear to have been more than six or seven
  specimens of this species (Plate <a href="#plate90">90</a>) recorded as
  British. Stephens mentions three of these, two males taken in the autumn
  of 1815, near Windsor; and one specimen, without date, in the Isle of
  Anglesea. Of the others one appears to have been taken in Yorkshire
  (1832), one in Essex, and another in North Wales (1859). Barrett also
  refers to a specimen, which was captured but afterwards escaped, near
  Bettws-y-Coed, North Wales, June, 1859, and gives some circumstantial
  details of the event. It appears, therefore, that of the very limited
  number of British <i>striata</i> North Wales has furnished almost half.
  The species is widely distributed in Europe, except the most northern
  part; the range extending into Asia Minor, Syria, Armenia, and Amurland.
  Abroad, it occurs on heaths, and in warm dry places. The caterpillar is
  blackish-brown, <!-- Page 168 --><span class="pagenum" title="268.png"><a
  name="page168"></a>{168}</span>marked with orange on the back, and white
  on the sides; the warts are yellowish, and the hairs arising therefrom
  are reddish brown; the head is black. It feeds in spring, after
  hibernation, on grasses, heather, and low herbage, and becomes full grown
  in May.</p>

<h5><b>The Speckled Footman</b> (<i>Coscinia cribrum</i>).</h5>

  <p>The fore wings are whitish, crossed by three rows of blackish grey
  dots, more or less connected, forming lines; and two streaks of the same
  colour through the length of the wings, but not always extending to the
  outer margin; a cross series of wedge-shaped marks or dots on the outer
  area; hind wings grey. Sometimes the fore wings are wholly suffused with
  the darker colour, and between such specimens and less frequent examples
  in which the wings are almost devoid of marking, there are many
  gradations (Plate <a href="#plate90">90</a>, Figs. 1 &#x2642;, 2
  &#x2640;; 4, 5, 6 vars.).</p>

  <p>Eggs received from the New Forest, June 25, 1907, were laid around a
  slender, bare, twig of heather, the batch measuring about three-quarters
  of an inch in length. At first they were golden yellow, but afterwards
  became pale purplish brown and very glossy (Plate <a
  href="#plate91">91</a>).</p>

  <p>Although the eggs appear to be more frequently laid on heather than on
  anything else, the caterpillars do not seem to be very partial to the
  plant as an article of food if others are available. At the present time
  (October 13) I have about a score or so of young larvæ feeding, and
  apparently thriving, on dandelion, lettuce, and grass, but they certainly
  seem to prefer the first named. They are now rather over half an inch in
  length, and yellowish brown in colour; there is a whitish grey stripe
  along the back; the warts are shining black, and the hairs arising from
  them are black, mixed with a few longer white ones; head blackish.</p>

  <p>Caterpillars after hibernation have been found on the grass, <!-- Page
  169 --><span class="pagenum" title="269.png"><a
  name="page169"></a>{169}</span><i>Aira cæspitosa</i>, during March from
  about the 10th onwards; they are then about a quarter of an inch long,
  and according to the late Mr. Fowler, always found on the sunny side of
  the clumps of <i>Aira</i> stretched out, and evidently enjoying the
  warmth of the sun. Some collected in that month were reared on groundsel,
  and produced moths from July 12 to August 20. The chrysalis is at first
  reddish, afterwards shining jet black; in a slight egg-shaped white
  silken cocoon, spun up in tufts of grass.</p>

  <p>In exceptional seasons the moth has emerged in late May, but June and
  July are the usual months, and it may occur as late as August. It rests
  among the heather, is easily disturbed on sunny days, and is very active
  on the wing, although it does not fly far before settling again. The
  species is very local in England, and only found on a heath near
  Bournemouth, in a heathy district between Ringwood and Verwood in Dorset,
  and in a not generally known part of the New Forest.</p>

<h5><b>The Crimson Speckled</b> (<i>Deiopeia pulchella</i>).</h5>

  <p>This white moth, prettily speckled with black and red dots, is a
  native of warmer countries than ours. However, it not only visits us now
  and then in the course of its wanderings, but if the migrants arrive in
  England at a suitable time of the year, the females most probably deposit
  eggs from which caterpillars may hatch, and some of them feed up and
  produce moths later in the same year. Stephens, writing in 1829, mentions
  a specimen taken many years previously in Yorkshire. This was no doubt
  the earliest known British example of Haworth's Crimson Speckled. A
  second specimen captured in a field near Christchurch, Hants, in October,
  1818, was figured by Samouelle in 1819. Between the year last mentioned
  and 1827, two other specimens occurred, both at Hove, Sussex. Stainton
  (1857) adds Epping, Manchester, Stowmarket, and Worthing. In 1869 <!--
  Page 170 --><span class="pagenum" title="270.png"><a
  name="page170"></a>{170}</span>three specimens were taken in the autumn;
  and a specimen was found at Scarborough in June, 1870, and one in Sussex.
  In 1871 a record was established, when at least thirty specimens were
  obtained at various places on the east, south, and south-west coasts, and
  in the Isle of Wight; one specimen being also recorded from Manchester.
  Two specimens were taken in Cornwall, May, 1874, and in the autumn of
  that year three occurred on the south coast, and one in Derbyshire. The
  moth seems not to have been noticed in the springs of 1875 or 1876, but
  twenty-four specimens were recorded later in the former year, and
  twenty-three in the latter. Between 1876 and 1892 less than twenty
  specimens were reported altogether, and the species was either entirely
  absent or overlooked in 1877, 1882, 1883, and from 1887 to 1891,
  inclusive. In 1892 several moths were captured in May and June on the
  coast; one at Brighton in July, two in the Hastings' district, and one at
  Folkestone in August. Since 1892 and up to 1907, a period of fifteen
  years, the species seems to have been rarely noted in England; the
  records showing in 1894 (2), 1895 (1), 1906 (1). In 1901 three specimens
  were reported as captured, and one seen at Earlsfield, Surrey, July 1 to
  15. (Plate <a href="#plate92">92</a>, Figs. 3, 4.)</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is greyish with black warts from which arise tufts of
  hairs, blackish on the back and pale greyish on the sides; a white line
  on the back, and one on the sides. Each ring is often barred with orange.
  Head reddish-ochreous marked with black. Feeds on forget-me-not
  (<i>Myosotis</i>), borage (<i>Borago</i>), etc. The chrysalis is reddish
  brown, enclosed in a white silken cocoon spun up among the food plant, or
  on the surface of the ground; in the latter case particles of earth
  adhere to the outside.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is said to feed only in the sunshine, so that in our
  islands the weather conditions would often be most unfavourable to the
  species in the larval state. On the other hand its sun-loving habit would
  expose it to the attacks of parasitical flies and other enemies. Anyway,
  the Crimson Speckled seems quite unable to increase and multiply to any
  extent even for a season in any part of England. Along the African and
  European borders of the Mediterranean there are evidently several
  generations of the moth in each year; the life cycle of the summer broods
  being short, but more protracted in the later brood. Brownlow states that
  eggs laid on October 20, hatched on the 22nd of the same month, and the
  caterpillar stage lasted until February of the following year.
  Distribution: Southern Europe, Africa, Canaries, Madeira; Asia Minor,
  Armenia, Central Asia; India, and Australia.</p>

  <p>Meyrick and others refer this species to <i>Utetheisa</i>, Hübn.</p>

<h5><b>The Cinnabar</b> (<i>Hipocrita jacobææ</i>).</h5>

  <p>This species was named the Cinnabar by Wilkes in 1773, such name of
  course referring to the more or less vermillion colour of the hind wings
  and the markings on the greyish black fore wings. The hind wings are
  often pinkish in tint, and probably it was to such specimens that Moses
  Harris gave the name "Pink Underwing." Very rarely the stripe on the
  front edge of the fore wings unites with the upper hind marginal spot;
  still less frequently there are some crimson scales in addition
  connecting the two hind marginal spots. Occasionally specimens have been
  recorded in which the usual red colour is replaced by bright yellow. The
  moth is shown on Plate <a href="#plate92">92</a>, Figs. 1, 2, and the
  early stages on Plate <a href="#plate93">93</a>, Fig. 1.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is orange yellow and each ring is banded with purplish
  black; the scanty hairs are short and blackish in colour. Head black.
  Feeds in July and August on ragwort (<i>Senecio jacobæa</i>) and
  sometimes occurs in such numbers as to completely clear large patches of
  the plant of every particle of green, leaving nothing but the tougher
  portions of the bare stems. <!-- Page 172 --><span class="pagenum" title="274.png"
  ><a name="page172"></a>{172}</span></p>

  <p>The chrysalis is dark-brown tinged with reddish; in a slight silken
  cocoon just under the surface of the ground, or among any loose material
  on the ground.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center">(Photo by W. J. Lucas.)</p>
  </div>

  <p>The moth is on the wing at the end of May and in June; odd specimens
  have occasionally been seen in April. It occurs on waste ground, sandy
  heaths, railway banks, downs, and hill-sides. Although fairly common
  generally, in some years it is not at all plentiful even when
  caterpillars may have abounded the previous season. When disturbed from
  among its food plant or herbage around, it is not very active on the
  wing, and is easily captured. Its usual time of flight is in the evening.
  Light seems to have an attraction for it, as it has been taken at gas
  lamps in towns, some distance from any place where the caterpillar could
  have fed.</p>

  <p>Occurs in all suitable places throughout the greater part of England
  and in Scotland up to Moray. Common in Ireland. Its range abroad includes
  all Europe, except the extreme north and extends into Asia.</p>

<h5><b>Footman Moths</b> (<i>Lithosiinæ</i>).</h5>

  <p>The members of this sub-family of Arctiidæ occurring in the British
  Isles are not numerous; we can only muster some fifteen species, and
  although a few are not uncommon, several are exceedingly local.</p>

  <p>The moths of the genus <i>Lithosia</i>, when resting, fold their drab
  or buff-coloured wings down closely along the body, and they then have a
  very elongate and stiff appearance which probably gave rise to their
  English name "Footmen." Most of them are very inactive, or even torpid
  during the daytime. They repose on the branches and leaves of trees and
  bushes, or among heather and other low herbage, and often fall to the
  ground when disturbed. At dusk they become active and then fly pretty
  briskly.</p>

  <p>The caterpillars are very hairy, the hairs arising in tufts from warts
  (tubercles) are usually short, but in some species are of moderate
  length. The majority hatch from the egg in the late summer, and do not
  complete their growth until the following year, about May or June. Some
  of them are known to be more or less active through the winter. In a
  state of nature most of the caterpillars feed on lichens growing on
  trees, bushes, rocks, or on the ground, but many kinds in confinement
  will thrive on a diet of lettuce or even withered leaves.</p>

  <p>In all cases the chrysalids are enclosed in silken cocoons, and these
  are spun up among the lichens, in crevices of bark, or other suitable
  crannies.</p>

<h5><b>The Red-necked Footman</b> (<i>Atolmis rubricollis</i>).</h5>

  <p>When newly emerged from the chrysalis this moth is black on all the
  wings, but it soon loses its early velvety sheen and <!-- Page 174
  --><span class="pagenum" title="278.png"><a
  name="page174"></a>{174}</span>becomes sooty in appearance; the last
  rings are orange, but all the rest of the body is black; the thorax also
  is black, but the part nearest the head, termed the collar, is red, hence
  the common English name Red-neck moth given to it by Harris (1778).
  Haworth called it the "Black Footman."</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is greyish, more or less freckled with ochreous; three
  lines along the back, the central one whitish, the others black and
  interrupted; the hairs arising from reddish warts are brown or greyish
  brown. Head black. It feeds from July to October on lichens, chiefly
  those growing on fir and oak, but also on beech, and on old palings.
  Chrysalis, glossy dark red-brown in a tight-fitting cocoon of silk mixed
  with the hairs of the caterpillar; spun up among the lichen. The moth is
  shown on Plate <a href="#plate92">92</a>, Figs. 5, 6, and the caterpillar
  and chrysalis on Plate <a href="#plate93">93</a>.</p>

  <p>The moth is on the wing in June and July; in forward seasons as early
  as the end of May. On a sunny afternoon it may be seen careering around
  trees, generally pretty high up. When resting the moths sit about on the
  trees or on the herbage under them. In some years it occurs in large
  numbers, but it is not usually very abundant, and sometimes even in its
  best localities only a few specimens will be seen during the season. It
  frequents woods, especially the larger ones, throughout the southern half
  of England up to Norfolk on the east, and Hereford on the west. In the
  northern counties it is rare, and is not common in Scotland or
  Ireland.</p>

  <p>Abroad, its range is through Central and Northern Europe, except the
  extreme north, to Dalmatia, Altai, and Amurland.</p>

<h5><b>The Muslin</b> (<i>Nudaria mundana</i>).</h5>

  <p>This delicate little moth has the semi-transparent fore wings pale
  greyish, faintly tinged with brown; crossed by irregular brownish lines;
  the hind wings are paler, shaded with a darker tint on the outer margins.
  Occasionally all the wings have a smoky tinge. The moth is shown on Plate
  <a href="#plate95">95</a>, Figs. 3, 6, and the caterpillar and chrysalis
  on Plate <a href="#plate94">94</a>, Fig. 2.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is greyish, with a broad whitish or yellowish stripe
  along the back, divided down the centre and edged by blackish lines; a
  velvety black mark on ring seven; raised warts and hairs dark greyish.
  Head black, shining; face yellowish. It may be found in April and May,
  after hibernation, on rocks, stone walls, especially those formed of
  loose cobbles or shale, trees, bushes, and even gate posts. I have beaten
  them from an old hawthorn hedge bordering a damp meadow in Middlesex, and
  collected them in numbers from the hollows of field boundary walls in
  North Devon. They feed on the tiny lichen that grows in such places as
  those indicated. The green, or yellowish-green chrysalis, is enclosed in
  a rather loose muslin-like silken cocoon, and is not difficult to obtain,
  especially from walls. It appears to be pretty generally distributed
  throughout England and Wales, except perhaps the midland and eastern
  counties; it occurs in the east and west of Scotland. In Ireland it is
  common, and often abundant, locally.</p>

  <p>Distribution: Northern and Central Europe.</p>

<h5><b>The Round-winged Muslin</b> (<i>Comacla senex</i>).</h5>

  <p>As indicated by the English name given to it by Haworth, the wings of
  this moth are rounder in outline than those of the Muslin, also named by
  Haworth. In general colour it agrees with that species, but it differs in
  having a larger central dot, and the cross lines are represented by
  blackish dots which, however, are not always well defined (Plate <a
  href="#plate95">95</a>, Figs. 1, 4).</p>

  <p>The caterpillar, as described by Buckler, is deep reddish-grey,
  thickly covered with hairs which are of two kinds; the majority are pale
  brown with black points and slightly feathered, others are longer, black,
  and densely feathered with soft pale-brown <!-- Page 176 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="282.png"><a
  name="page176"></a>{176}</span>plumage. Head black and shining. It feeds
  in August and, after hibernation, in May on lichens and mosses growing on
  the ground in marshes and fens. It is known to eat <i>Peltigera
  canina</i>, and the mosses <i>Hypnum sericeum</i>, and <i>Weissia
  serrata</i>. Although occurring, in July and August, in marshy places in
  several parts of Southern England and Wales, it is especially common in
  fen land. In such localities as Wicken, for example, it flies at early
  dusk in hundreds all over the fen on favourable nights, but if there
  happens to be a breeze the moths will not leave their retreat among the
  herbage. Later on in the night, if on the wing, they readily assemble
  around a brightly burning lamp, and are satisfied to sit on the herbage
  illuminated by its rays. In Northern England it is known to be not
  uncommon in some districts of Yorkshire, and it probably occurs in other
  counties also. There appears to be only a single record each from Ireland
  and Scotland.</p>

<h5><b>The Rosy Footman</b> (<i>Miltochrista miniata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The fore wings of this pretty little moth are ochreous yellow tinged
  with pink; the front and hind margins are bright pink, in some cases
  approaching vermillion; the markings are bluish black; hind wings rather
  paler. It varies in the amount of black markings, which are sometimes
  almost absent, and in colour ranges from yellow to orange. (Plate <a
  href="#plate95">95</a>, Figs. 2, 5.)</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is dark drab covered above with blackish,
  mouse-coloured plumed hairs; on rings one and eleven the plumose hairs
  are replaced by short simple ones; the hairs of the side tufts are plain.
  Head brown, the cheeks outlined in black (adapted from Hellins). Lichens
  growing upon the stems and branches of trees supply this caterpillar with
  food, and it seems to nibble on all favourable opportunities throughout
  the winter. It hatches from the egg in August, and is full grown in May.
  Boden, writing in September, 1896 (<i>The Entomologist</i>) noted that
  some caterpillars had then attained the perfect state, while others were
  still feeding, and he adds that the caterpillars actually attacked and
  ate up the moths. Although there seems to be few records from the
  Midlands, this species appears to be widely distributed over England as
  far north as Yorkshire. In Ireland it has been recorded from Claring
  Bridge and East Galway. The moth is out in July. It is a wood-loving
  insect, but is also found on heaths, and even in lanes and the borders of
  fields when plenty of trees occur in such places. It may occasionally be
  beaten out of trees and bushes in the day time but it is on the wing at
  dusk, and although it is a high flier, specimens come within reach now
  and then. Light and sugar both attract it. The species ranges through
  Central and Northern Europe, and in Asia to Japan.</p>

<h5><b>The Dew Moth</b> (<i>Endrosa irrorella</i>).</h5>

  <p>Varies in colour from yellowish buff to creamy white, the colour on
  the margins always deeper; the rows of black spots on the fore wings are
  usually well defined, but sometimes those of the two central series are
  very faint, or quite absent, whilst an unusual number appear in the outer
  marginal series, Occasionally black scales appear on the veins,
  connecting the spots, and forming the figures <img src="images/mark2.png"
  class="middle" style="height:2ex;" alt="sideways vee between horizontal bars"
  /> more or less distinctly; such forms are known as var. <i>signata</i>,
  Borkh. The moth appears in June and July. (Plate <a
  href="#plate95">95</a>, Figs. 7, 9.)</p>

  <p>When resting, the moth hangs from a blade of grass, or leaf of some
  plant; it then has a very transparent appearance. Barrett suggests that
  this gave rise to the English name it now bears, and by which it was
  known to Haworth and entomologists of his time.</p>

  <p>Buckler and Hellins describe the caterpillar as blackish-brown above,
  and dark-reddish grey or purplish grey on the sides; a series of yellow
  spots along the middle of the back, then a white <!-- Page 178 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="286.png"><a name="page178"></a>{178}</span>and
  yellow interrupted line, followed by a light yellow stripe under the
  spiracles; raised spots blackish, some white; hairs blackish brown. Head
  black.</p>

  <p>It feeds, in the sunshine, on the black and yellow lichens growing in
  the haunts of the species, which are edges of cliffs and rough stony
  places near the sea, and also on hillsides. The species occurs, perhaps,
  more abundantly on the Kentish and Sussex coast than inland, but it is
  certainly not confined to the cliffs at Dover and Folkestone in Kent, or
  at Ventnor, Isle of Wight. Among inland localities for it are Box Hill,
  Ranmore, Reigate, and other places on the Surrey hills. It has also been
  recorded from the Cotswolds in Gloucestershire; the Isle of Man; St.
  Davids, South Wales; Aberdeenshire, Sutherlandshire, and the Tweed, Tay,
  Clyde, and Argyll districts in Scotland. For Ireland, Kane gives Mayo;
  "Ardrahan, County Galway, and west through the Burren of Clare, widely
  spread."</p>

<h5><b>The Four-dotted Footman</b> (<i>Cybosia mesomella</i>).</h5>

  <p>Fore wings pale creamy white, the margins yellowish: a black dot near
  the costa, and another below near the inner margin; hind wings suffused
  with blackish grey. Rarely the fore wings are yellow with a whitish
  central shade, and the hind wings are yellowish. (Plate <a
  href="#plate95">95</a>, Figs. 8, 10.)</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is velvety blackish grey; warts thickly set with
  densely feathered blackish hairs. Feeds in April and May, after
  hibernation, on lichens growing among heather. In confinement it will,
  according to Buckler, eat heather and fresh or withered leaves of
  sallow.</p>

  <p>Fairly well distributed over England. It appears to be absent from
  Ireland, but in Scotland it is known to occur in the Clyde, Solway, and
  Moray districts, and has been recorded from Aberdeenshire. In the South
  of England it affects heaths and the more open woods; sometimes not
  uncommon in <!-- Page 179 --><span class="pagenum" title="287.png"><a
  name="page179"></a>{179}</span>such places. The moth, in June, may be
  disturbed from bushes, or put up from the heather as one walks through.
  As the sun goes down it may often be seen on the wing, but later in the
  evening is its chief time of activity. In Lancashire and Cheshire it is
  found on the mosses, and Cannock Chase in Staffordshire is a noted
  locality for it. Still obtained in Chippenham fen, but Barrett states
  that it is now supposed to be extinct in the fens of Wicken, Yaxley, and
  Burwell, in all of which it used to abound.</p>

<h5><b>The Four-spotted Footman</b> (<i>&OElig;onestis quadra</i>).</h5>

  <p>The sexes of this species are very different in appearance. The fore
  wings of the male are grey tinged with yellowish, except on the outer
  fourth; the basal fourth is yellow. The female is larger and yellow in
  colour; each fore wing has two black spots, sometimes unusually large,
  sometimes mere dots, and more rarely absent altogether. (Plate <a
  href="#plate95">95</a>, Figs. 11, 12.)</p>

  <p>Caterpillar blackish with four wavy yellow lines along the back, the
  spaces between the lines powdered and freckled with yellow giving a grey
  appearance; raised spots on the back red, those on the sides greyish; a
  black cross on rings three, seven, and eleven; hairs grey mixed with
  black. Head black and glossy. It feeds, after hibernation, in May and
  June, on lichens, preferring those upon oak trees. In the breeding cage
  it is apt to eat its companions, especially when many are crowded into a
  small receptacle. (Plate <a href="#plate94">94</a>, Fig. 3.)</p>

  <p>The moth emerges in July, and during that month, and sometimes in
  August, it may be seen on tree trunks; but it more often reposes on the
  branches, from which it may be dislodged by jarring the boughs with a
  stick, when it drops rather than flies towards the ground, but generally
  manages to arrest its downward course by catching hold of a spray of
  bracken or some other plant and there awaits capture. Night is the usual
  <!-- Page 180 --><span class="pagenum" title="288.png"><a
  name="page180"></a>{180}</span>time of flight, but it is on the wing at
  dusk. It is partial to "sugar" and has been known to visit flowers.</p>

  <p>This species has been recorded from a large number of localities in
  England extending from the Scilly Isles to the Scottish border. From the
  circumstances connected with many of such captures one is led to suspect
  that the insect has migratory habits. In England the most favoured
  locality is the New Forest in Hampshire, where it abounds in some
  seasons, but is quite scarce in others. It occurs, more or less
  regularly, in the larger woods in Dorset, extending into Devon; also in
  Sussex ranging into Kent, but is only occasionally common in either of
  these counties. Generally considered to be uncommon in the eastern
  counties, but has been reported to occur in large numbers at Aldeburgh in
  Suffolk. The localities given in Kane's catalogue of the Lepidoptera of
  Ireland are Killarney, Timoleague, Co. Cork, Curraghmore (abundant),
  Lismore, Borris, Co. Carlow, and Clonbrock. To these may be added Dublin,
  and Nenagh, Co. Tipperary.</p>

  <p>Distribution: Central Europe, Southern Sweden, Livonia, Dalmatia,
  Armenia, Amurland, Corea, and Japan.</p>

<h5><b>The Buff Footman</b> (<i>Lithosia deplana</i>).</h5>

  <p>Fore wings, ochreous grey, tinged with yellow on the basal half of the
  front margins; hind wings paler, becoming greyer on the outer area;
  fringes of all the wings yellow. The male is fairly constant in colour,
  but the female sometimes has a distinct yellow stripe on the front margin
  of the fore wings extending to the fringes (var. <i>ochreola</i>, Hübn.);
  more rarely in the New Forest (?), and in the Isle of Purbeck a form
  occurs with the fore wings orange buff, and the hind wings only slightly
  tinged with grey (var. <i>unicolor</i>, Bankes). (Plate <a
  href="#plate97">97</a>, Figs. 1-3.)</p>

  <p>Caterpillar, greyish, or greenish grey, freckled with darker, hairs
  grey inclining to brownish; a broad creamy or yellowish stripe, edged
  with black and traversed by a dark central line along the back. Head
  blackish and glossy. From August to June on lichens growing on stems and
  branches of yew, oak, and beech.</p>

  <p>A local species, and although recorded now and then from several other
  parts of the country, and once from Killarney in Ireland, seems to be
  pretty much confined to the counties of Surrey, Sussex, Hants, Dorset,
  and Devon. The moth, which is out in July, rests during the day upon the
  boughs and among the foliage of oak, beech, and yew, the latter
  especially in the Dorking district of Surrey.</p>

  <p>Distribution: Central Europe, Southern Scandinavia, Livonia, Northern
  Italy, Roumelia, and Russia.</p>

<h5><b>The Dingy Footman</b> (<i>Lithosia griseola</i>).</h5>

  <p>Haworth's English name for this moth was the "Dun Footman." In its
  typical form the fore wings are pale greyish with a yellowish front
  edging; the latter most distinct towards the base; the hind wings are
  whitish ochreous more or less suffused with grey. The pale form, var.
  <i>flava</i>, Haw. = <i>stramineola</i>, Doubl. at one time considered a
  distinct species (the Straw-coloured Footman of Haworth), has pale
  straw-coloured fore wings and white ochreous hind wings. (Plate <a
  href="#plate97">97</a>, Figs. 4, 5.)</p>

  <p>Caterpillar, sooty brown, with a darker line down the middle of the
  back and an interrupted yellow or orange line or stripe on each side of
  it; dark brown hairs arising from dark warts; head glossy black
  (described from a skin). It may be looked for in the spring months on the
  lichens affecting alders and sallows growing in fens and marshy places.
  (Plate <a href="#plate98">98</a>, Fig. 2.)</p>

  <p>The moth is abundant in the Cambridge and Norfolk fens, and is common
  in boggy places in the New Forest, but it probably occurs in all suitable
  places throughout England and Wales. It does not seem to have been
  observed in Ireland, <!-- Page 182 --><span class="pagenum" title="292.png"
  ><a name="page182"></a>{182}</span>but has been recorded from Moray in
  Scotland. The yellow variety, which by the way is not known to occur
  abroad, is found, with the ordinary form, chiefly in the Norfolk fens and
  in the New Forest; but it is also to be obtained, though less frequently,
  in Surrey (Weybridge district), Berkshire (Reading district), and still
  more rarely elsewhere. It is out in July.</p>

  <p>Distribution: Central Europe, South Russia, Ural, Altai, Amurland,
  Corea, Japan, and West Africa.</p>

<h5><b>The Common Footman</b> (<i>Lithosia lurideola</i>).</h5>

  <p>Fore wings, leaden grey with a yellow stripe terminating in a point at
  the tip of the wing; the hind wings are pale ochreous yellow. It appears
  in July, sometimes at the end of June.</p>

  <p>Caterpillar, dark greyish covered with blackish hairs arising from
  black warts on the back, and yellowish hairs from similar coloured warts
  on the sides; three black or blackish lines on the back, and an orange
  stripe along the sides from the fourth to eleventh rings; head black.
  August to June. Generally supposed to feed, in a state of nature, on
  lichen growing on trees and bushes. It has been reared on the foliage of
  sallow, apple, and oak; also known to eat buckthorn, clematis, dogwood,
  etc. I have occasionally beaten it from old hedgerows, and have
  frequently seen it on trunks of poplar and ash upon which not much in the
  way of lichen could be seen. Such caterpillars, when taken, have almost
  invariably spun up soon afterwards. The moth is shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate97">97</a>, Fig. 6, and the early stages on Plate <a
  href="#plate96">96</a>, Fig. 2.</p>

  <p>This species is perhaps the commonest and most generally distributed
  member of the genus in England. It becomes much less frequent in northern
  pasts of Lancashire, and in Yorkshire it is local, but recorded as common
  in the south-east of that county. It occurs in Scotland, whence it has
  been recorded from Clydesdale, Aberdeenshire, and Moray. Kane <!-- Page
  183 --><span class="pagenum" title="293.png"><a
  name="page183"></a>{183}</span>states that it is common near Galway, and
  also gives Castle Bellingham, Clogher Head (not rare), and Athlone as
  Irish localities.</p>

  <p>Distributed over Europe, except the extreme north, Andalusia and
  Southern Italy; the range extending to Asia Minor and Armenia. In
  Amurland, Corea, and Japan, it is represented by <i>coreana</i>,
  Leech.</p>

<h5><b>The Scarce Footman</b> (<i>Lithosia complana</i>).</h5>

  <p>Very similar in appearance to the last species, the yellow stripe
  along the front edge of the fore wings, however, does not terminate in a
  point, but is continued through to the fringes; the hind wings are
  sometimes distinctly yellow, and with but little, if any, greyish shading
  on the front area. (Plate <a href="#plate97">97</a>, Fig. 7.)</p>

  <p>Caterpillar, brown or brownish grey above, and paler beneath; a
  white-edged black line along the middle of the back, and a row of orange
  spots, alternating with whitish ones, on each side of the line; the
  orange spots faint or absent on rings one to three; an interrupted yellow
  or orange stripe along the sides; the brownish warts are thickly studded
  with short greyish brown hairs. Head black and glossy (described from a
  skin). From August to June. The most usual food is probably lichens on
  trees, but it is said to eat moss, knot-grass, clover, and the flowers of
  bird's-foot trefoil, etc. (Plate <a href="#plate96">96</a>, Fig. 3.)</p>

  <p>The moth is out in July and part of August, and may be disturbed in
  the daytime from its resting-place among heather and low herbage. It is
  on the wing in the dusk of the evening, and when the weather is
  favourable, flies freely. As it has a weakness for sweets, it should be
  looked for at night, by the aid of a lantern, on the flowers of knapweed
  and thistle. It chiefly affects heaths, but it is also found in woods,
  and on sandhills by the sea, as in Norfolk. A local species, but usually
  to be more or less frequently met with in all the eastern <!-- Page 184
  --><span class="pagenum" title="294.png"><a
  name="page184"></a>{184}</span>and southern counties, and in some of the
  midland. Rare in Wales, Cheshire, Lancashire, and York. Only doubtfully
  recorded from Scotland. In Ireland it is widely distributed, and,
  according to Kane, not uncommon where it occurs.</p>

<h5><b>The Northern Footman</b> (<i>Lithosia sericea</i>).</h5>

  <p>Gregson named and described this insect in 1860, and in the following
  year Guenée described it as <i>L. molybdeola</i>. It seems to be peculiar
  to England; and only occurs on the mosses of Lancashire and Cheshire. The
  fore wings are somewhat narrower and darker in colour than those of the
  Scarce Footman; and the hind wings are suffused, to a greater or lesser
  extent, with dark grey. Some entomologists maintain that this is probably
  only a small form of <i>L. complana</i>. According to Mr. Pierce it
  cannot be specifically separated from that species or from <i>L.
  pygmæola</i> by the genitalia, the usual test in such matters. Prout,
  however, has stated that Speyer, in 1867, pointed out structural
  differences, not only in the shape of the wings, but also in the size of
  the costal tuft of scales on the underside of the fore wings. It should
  be added that there does not seem to be any material difference between
  the caterpillar of <i>complana</i> and that of <i>sericea</i>. Anyway,
  the question of form or species may here be left open. The fact of the
  Northern, or Gregson's, Footman being an exclusive British production
  invests the insect with an importance greatly above that attaching to the
  majority of our moths. The moth is depicted on Plate <a
  href="#plate97">97</a>, Fig. 8.</p>

<h5><b>The Pigmy Footman</b> (<i>Lithosia lutarella</i>).</h5>

  <p>Ochreous white, sometimes tinged with greyish, or with yellowish; hind
  wings clouded with greyish on the front area. Female almost always
  smaller than the male. The fore wings <!-- Page 185 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="295.png"><a name="page185"></a>{185}</span>vary a
  good deal in the matter of colour, the extremes being yellow and dark
  grey. (Plate <a href="#plate99">99</a>, Figs. 3, 4.)</p>

  <p>Buckler describes the caterpillar as brown on the back, with a central
  thick black line, and two dark brown lines; sides paler brown, with a
  dusty white line along the spiracles; the warts (tubercles) with short
  brown hairs, and the head black. August to June.</p>

  <p>This extremely local little moth was unknown as an inhabitant of
  Britain until 1847, when it was described as <i>L. pygmæola</i>, by
  Doubleday in the <i>Zoologist</i> for that year, and noted as having been
  found among rushes on the coast of Kent. Two years later the insect was
  again referred to, and it was then stated to be confined to a "space of
  about four hundred yards in extent, on the coast of Deal." It then became
  known as the "Deal Footman." During the past seventy years or so large
  numbers have no doubt been removed from this locality, which is the only
  British one it was known to occur in. It is still to be found there,
  although said to be less common than formerly. In the <i>Entomologist</i>
  for September, 1912, this species was recorded as not uncommon on marram
  grass growing on the Norfolk coast.</p>

  <p>Some present-day entomologists still incline to the opinion that the
  moth is a distinct species, and not a local race of <i>lutarella</i>,
  which is found throughout Central and Eastern Europe; ranging to South
  Scandinavia, Finland, and eastward to Siberia and Amurland. The var.
  <i>pygmæola</i> has been obtained in Holland.</p>

<h5><b>The Hoary Footman</b> (<i>Lithosia caniola</i>).</h5>

  <p>Fore wings silky whitish grey with a yellowish streak along the front
  edge; the hind wings are whitish with a faint yellowish tinge. Some of
  the specimens are entirely whitish (var. <i>lacteola</i>, Boisd.). July
  and August, sometimes earlier. (Plate <a href="#plate99">99</a>, Figs. 1,
  2.) <!-- Page 186 --><span class="pagenum" title="296.png"><a
  name="page186"></a>{186}</span></p>

  <p>Caterpillar greyish brown, with a black line along the back, and a
  series of irregular orange marks, representing stripes, on each side of
  it; these orange marks are outwardly edged with black; an orange line low
  down along the sides; warts greyish or brownish, each bearing a tuft of
  short pale hairs. Head blackish, shining, notched on the crown, and
  studded with pale bristles in front. Fed on lettuce from April 30, the
  date they were received from Mr. Walker of Torquay. They were then quite
  small, the largest not more than half an inch in length. They pupated in
  June, and the moths emerged in July, all fine specimens. (Plate <a
  href="#plate98">98</a>, Fig. 1.)</p>

  <p>In the open the caterpillar feeds upon the black lichens growing on
  rocks, etc., by the sea; also upon Dutch clover (<i>Trifolium
  repens</i>), kidney vetch (<i>Anthyllis vulneraria</i>), and bird's-foot
  trefoil (<i>Lotus corniculatus</i>).</p>

  <p>This species was not known to occur in any part of the British Isles
  until August, 1861, when the late Mr. C. G. Barrett took four specimens
  on the Hill of Howth in Ireland (<i>vide Ent. Annual</i>, 1862, p. 106).
  A large number were subsequently captured or reared from caterpillars
  obtained in the same locality by others. Kane ("Cat. Lep. Ireland")
  remarks that the colony flourished at Howth for many years, but that the
  species seemingly perished in the severe winters of 1878 or 1879, and
  unless a specimen taken in 1890 was this species, has not since been seen
  there. The only other Irish locality from which it has been recorded
  (August, 1866) is on the coast near Waterford. Torquay, where the species
  was first observed in 1864 is now a noted locality, and it is said to
  occur in certain spots along the coast to Babbicombe. Other localities in
  Devon are Dartmouth, Torcross, and Bolt Head. Barrett found the species
  rarely in two places by the sea in South Pembrokeshire, and mentions Rye
  in Sussex, and Romney Marsh in Kent, as localities where specimens have
  occurred.</p>

  <p>Mr. J. Walker informs me that the moths fly at dusk, and <!-- Page 187
  --><span class="pagenum" title="297.png"><a
  name="page187"></a>{187}</span>that they all seem to get active at almost
  the same moment, and settle again in the same way at the end of their
  first flight, which lasts about half an hour. After dark the rays of an
  acetylene lamp directed downwards into the bushes will attract them from
  their retreat. Occasionally they visit "sugar."</p>

  <p>Abroad this is a southern species, but its range extends to Western
  Germany, the Tyrol, Switzerland, and South Hungary, as well as to
  England; also to Asia Minor.</p>

<h5><b>The Orange Footman</b> (<i>Lithosia sororcula</i>).</h5>

  <p>This moth is orange yellow on the fore wings, and a paler shade of the
  same colour on the hind wings. Except that the tint is brighter in some
  specimens and darker in others, there is nothing to mention in the way of
  aberration. (Plate <a href="#plate99">99</a>, Figs. 6, 7.)</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is white on the back with five black stripes, the
  outer ones broader than the others; all these stripes are broken up by
  brownish patches, and they fail to show at all on the eighth ring, which,
  therefore, is conspicuously white; the sides are smoky grey marked with
  white on the second and third rings; the warts are reddish, bearing smoky
  grey hairs. It may be found from July to September on the lichens growing
  on the trunks of oak trees. The moth does not appear until the following
  May or June, when it may be beaten from branches. Not uncommon in the
  woods, chiefly oak, of Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex, Kent, Surrey, Hampshire,
  and Dorset; it also occurs in Cambridgeshire and Sussex. In Berkshire and
  Bucks it is fairly common, but seems to affect the beech woods in those
  counties. Recorded from Ireland by Birchall, who stated that it was
  abundant at Killarney.</p>

<h5><b>The Dotted Footman</b> (<i>Pelosia muscerda</i>).</h5>

  <p>The fore wings are pale grey suffused with pale reddish-brown except
  on the costal area: there are six black dots, two <!-- Page 188 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="298.png"><a name="page188"></a>{188}</span>before
  the middle of the wing and placed above the inner margin, and four beyond
  the middle in an oblique series from the costa; the hind wings are pale
  brownish-grey, becoming somewhat darker towards the apex. (Plate <a
  href="#plate99">99</a>, Fig. 5.)</p>

  <p>Caterpillar velvety blackish-brown, marbled with reddish-grey; stripe
  along middle of the back, and a line on each side of it deep black; warts
  and hairs brown, the latter short but numerous; a pair of red spots on
  ring one, and another pair on ring twelve; beneath the spiracles is a
  fine reddish-grey line; under surface pinkish grey; head small and
  blackish (Buckler). So far it has escaped detection in its fenny home,
  but it has been reared from eggs laid by a captured female. Caterpillars
  obtained in this way seem to have thrived on a mixed diet of lichens,
  mosses, and withered leaves of bramble and sallow. August to May. Buckler
  states that the dark chestnut-brown pupa is enclosed in a double cocoon,
  the inner a webby one of greyish silk, and the outer one thinner and
  composed of white silk. The whole affair was formed in a curled-up
  bramble leaf. The caterpillar is figured on Plate <a
  href="#plate98">98</a>, Fig. 5.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in late July and through August. It has been obtained
  in a certain marshy locality in the New Forest, Hants, and also in some
  marshes at Sandwich, Kent. Its chief haunts are, however, in the fens of
  Norfolk, such as those on the river Bure, and Brundall fen on the Yare,
  but Horning and Ranworth are, perhaps, the headquarters of the species.
  It may be mentioned that when Stephens wrote about this insect in 1829
  only two specimens had then occurred in Britain, and these had been found
  in a marsh at Horning floating upon the water in a ditch.</p>

  <p>Distribution: Central Europe, Denmark, Sweden, Livonia, Dalmatia,
  Corsica and Sardinia, Amurland and Japan.</p>

<h5 class="lg125">NOCTUIDÆ.</h5>

  <p>This extensive assemblage of moths, commonly known as noctuas, and
  locally as "millers," "owlets," and "buzzards," has been divided by
  Staudinger into five sub-families&mdash;Acronyctinæ, Trifinæ,
  Gonopterinæ, Quadrifinæ, and Hypeninæ. These divisions are here adopted,
  and the arrangement of species is adhered to pretty closely, except in
  the Trifinæ, where it has been considered necessary to make sundry
  alterations so as to fall more in line with later classification, at
  least so far as concerns genera.</p>

  <p>The eggs of species in this family are round and somewhat flattened in
  shape, and the shell is fluted or netted. Some few examples of these have
  been figured.</p>

  <p>Most of the larvæ conceal themselves during the day, in the ground,
  among low herbage, or in spun-together leaves, and only leave their
  retreat at night to feed. Most kinds change to the chrysalis state
  underground, but some pupate among leaves or in chinks of tree bark,
  etc.</p>

  <p>With some few exceptions the moths fly only at night, by far the
  larger number will visit the sugar patch, and others come readily to
  flowers or to light.</p>

  <p>Distribution abroad will only be referred to where this is restricted
  in Europe, or extends far beyond European limits.</p>

<h5 class="lg125">ACRONYCTINÆ.</h5>

<h5><b>The Scarce Merveille du Jour</b> (<i>Diphtera orion</i>).</h5>

  <p>This pretty moth has the fore wings green variegated with white
  stripes and black cross lines; the hind wings are greyish, marked with
  white at the anal angle. The spaces between the interrupted cross lines
  of the fore wings are often marked with <!-- Page 190 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="302.png"><a name="page190"></a>{190}</span>black,
  and this is the typical form of the species; the plainer
  specimens&mdash;those less spotted with black&mdash;being referable to
  var. <i>runica</i>, Stephens. Stephens in 1829 notes that the species was
  then little known in England. It is still very local, inhabiting oak
  woods in Sussex (Hailsham), Hampshire (New Forest, sometimes common),
  Devonshire (Plymouth district), Cornwall (East Looe), Essex (Colchester),
  and Suffolk (Ipswich). The moth is out in June; on September 5, 1906, Mr.
  L. W. Newman bred a small specimen that had only been in the chrysalis
  seventeen days. Usually it rests by day on boughs, and sometimes on the
  trunks of trees (see Fig. 8, p. <a href="#page9">9</a>); it flies at
  night and then patronizes the sugar patch, but often is a late visitor.
  The caterpillar, which feeds upon oak in July and August, is black on the
  back with a yellow or whitish blotch on rings four, six, and nine; the
  reddish warts are crowned with tufts of brown or whitish hairs. Head
  black marked with yellow except on the top. It is also said to eat leaves
  of beech and birch. Staudinger gives <i>alpium</i>, Osbeck (1778), as an
  earlier name than <i>orion</i>, Esp. Hampson refers alpinum to
  <i>Daseochæta</i>, Warren.</p>

  <p>Distribution: Central and Northern Europe, and represented by var.
  <i>murrhina</i>, Graes., in Amurland, China, and Japan.</p>

  <p>The moth is depicted on Plate <a href="#plate100">100</a>, Fig. 1, and
  the caterpillar and chrysalis on Plate <a href="#plate101">101</a>, Figs.
  2, 2<i>a</i>.</p>

<h5><b>The Nut-tree Tussock</b> (<i>Demas coryli</i>).</h5>

  <p>Usually the fore wings of this moth appear to be brownish, or reddish
  brown on the basal half, and whitish, more or less suffused with greyish,
  or sometimes reddish brown, on the outer half; the hind wings are pale
  brownish, or greyish, lighter towards the base. Not infrequently the fore
  wings are greyish white with some brownish clouding between the two
  blackish cross lines. The caterpillar is variable in colour, but
  generally of some shade of brown, ranging from dark chocolate brown to
  <!-- Page 191 --><span class="pagenum" title="303.png"><a
  name="page191"></a>{191}</span>pale ochreous, covered with soft hair; the
  pencils of long hairs on the first ring, and the tufts of hairs on rings
  four, five, and eleven, may be red, greyish, or blackish; the broken
  stripe along the back is greyish, and the stripe low down on each side
  may be red, brown, or greyish. It feeds in June and July, and as a second
  generation in September, on the foliage of beech, birch, hazel, hornbeam,
  etc.: bushes growing in exposed positions such as a hedge bank or hill
  side are chiefly fancied. The moth flies in May and June, and again in
  August and September. It probably occurs in most of the English counties,
  but is most frequent in Berkshire, Bucks, and Devon. Not uncommon in
  Clydesdale, but more plentiful in Aberdeenshire, and is also obtained in
  Perthshire, and in other parts of Scotland. Widely distributed in
  Ireland.</p>

  <p>The moth is shown on Plate <a href="#plate100">100</a>, Fig. 2, and
  the early stages on Plate <a href="#plate101">101</a>, Figs. 3,
  3<i>a</i>, 3<i>b</i>.</p>

<h5><b>The Miller</b> (<i>Acronycta leporina</i>).</h5>

  <p>In its typical form the wings are quite white with but little in the
  way of marking. Most, if not all, the specimens occurring in Britain are
  the more or less greyish suffused and more marked, variety known as
  <i>bradyporina</i>, Treits. (Plate <a href="#plate100">100</a>, Figs. 3
  &#x2642;, 4 &#x2640;.) Sometimes the outer margins of the fore wings,
  beyond the second cross line, are shaded or dusted with blackish (var.
  <i>semivirga</i>, Tutt). In the Liverpool district a form is occasionally
  obtained in which the fore wings are darkly suffused, and the thorax is
  black (var. <i>melanocephala</i>, Mansbridge). A specimen with black fore
  wings and white fringes has been bred from a caterpillar found in Essex
  (<i>Entomologist</i>, xxxviii., 289, and xxxix., 97).</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is pale green clothed with long white, and a few black
  hairs; these fall downwards, and on the one side curve forwards, and on
  the other side backwards. Sometimes in the <!-- Page 192 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="304.png"><a name="page192"></a>{192}</span>south
  of England, more frequently in the north, the ground colour and hairs are
  yellow, and there are more or less distinct reddish brown bands on the
  back and sides. It may be found from July to September, or even later, on
  birch or alder, rarely on oak and poplar. The moth occurs in May and
  June, as a rule. In 1904 I took a freshly emerged specimen on July 23, at
  Byfleet in Surrey, and some half-grown caterpillars were obtained on the
  same day, and very near the same spot. The species is found in woods, and
  on heaths and mosses, where birch or alder flourishes, from Devonshire in
  England to Sutherlandshire in Scotland. It is not common anywhere in our
  islands, but is perhaps most frequently met with in the south and east of
  England. In Ireland it appears to have been found only in the southern
  counties.</p>

<h5><b>The Sycamore</b> (<i>Acronycta aceris</i>).</h5>

  <p>The dark mottled grey moth on Plate <a href="#plate100">100</a>, Fig.
  5, is not much given to variation, but occasionally brownish suffused
  forms occur (var. <i>candelisequa</i>, Esp. = <i>infuscata</i>,
  Haworth).</p>

  <p>The caterpillar (Plate <a href="#plate102">102</a>, Fig. 3) feeds in
  August and September upon sycamore, maple, and sometimes plum and
  chestnut. It has some black-edged white marks along the middle of the
  back; the pointed tufts of long hairs are yellow or reddish. When it is
  at rest on the underside of a leaf, or coils in a ring on being
  disturbed, the hair tufts gave the creature a somewhat prickly
  appearance. The moth is out in June and July.</p>

  <p>The species is more or less common pretty well through the southern
  and eastern counties, and fairly so in and around London. Its range
  extends to Warwickshire and Herefordshire; but it is scarce in both
  counties. The Irish localities for it are Claring Bridge and Ahascragh,
  Co. Galway; Glandore and Timologue, Co. Cork; Enniskillen, Co.
  Fermanagh.</p>

<h5><b>The Poplar Grey</b> (<i>Acronycta megacephala</i>).</h5>

  <p>This moth is somewhat like that last noticed, but the fore wings are
  darker grey; the whitish orbicular mark is margined with black, and has a
  dark central dot. Sometimes the fore wings are clouded with blackish, and
  occasionally entirely suffused with black. In several species of
  <i>Acronycta</i> newly disclosed specimens have a faint pinky tinge, but
  this is especially noticeable in the present species. (Plate <a
  href="#plate100">100</a>, Fig. 6.)</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is ochreous or grey brown, marked with blackish; a
  conspicuous character is a black-edged whitish or ochreous patch on ring
  ten; the hairs are whitish, those on the sides rather long. It feeds from
  July to September on the foliage of poplars. (Plate <a
  href="#plate101">101</a>, Fig. 1).</p>

  <p>This well-known cockney species is on the wing from late May to
  mid-August. Has been bred in September from a caterpillar taken in July,
  also in October from August larvæ. It is often abundant on poplars
  (especially the caterpillars) in London and suburbs. Common all over the
  southern parts of England, except perhaps in Devon and Cornwall; its
  range extends through Northern England to Ross in Scotland; and it is
  found in the south of Ireland.</p>

<h5><b>The Alder</b> (<i>Acronycta alni</i>).</h5>

  <div class="figright" style="width:25%;">

    <p style="text-align:center"><b>Caterpillar of the Alder-Moth.</b></p>

    <p style="text-align:center">(Photo by W. J. Lucas.)</p>
  </div>

  <p>The sexes of this black-clouded grey moth are shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate100">100</a>, Figs. 8 and 9&#x2640;. Except that the black
  clouding sometimes spreads over a greater area of the fore wings, there
  is little to note in aberration, at least in a general way. In 1906 a
  melanic specimen was bred from a chrysalis taken from alder in Delamere
  Forest, Cheshire; this is probably referable to var. <i>steinerti</i>,
  Caspari.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar (Fig. 26) is black, marked with yellow; the <!-- Page
  194 --><span class="pagenum" title="308.png"><a
  name="page194"></a>{194}</span>curious clubbed hairs are its
  distinguishing feature. Although named after the alder, it feeds on the
  leaves of most trees and bushes in July and August, sometimes earlier or
  later. The moth is out in May and June, but although an occasional
  specimen has been taken at sugar or light, once resting on nettles, it is
  rarely met with. Caterpillars also are not by any means common, and any
  one who may obtain even a single example in a season may congratulate
  himself on a good find. They are perhaps most frequent in the Hampshire
  (New Forest) district and some of the Sussex woodlands, but have occurred
  now and then in almost every county of England up to Yorkshire; also in
  Glamorganshire, Carmarthenshire, and at Trefriw in Wales. The only Irish
  locality is Powerscourt, Co. Wicklow. The range abroad extends to
  Armenia, Amurland, and Japan.</p>

<h5><b>The Marsh Dagger</b> (<i>Acronycta strigosa</i>).</h5>

  <p>This little moth, known also as the "Grisette," seems confined, as a
  British species, to the country around Cambridge; but it has been twice
  recorded from Norfolk, two specimens have been reported from
  Worcestershire, and one from Gloucestershire; the latter at sugar in
  June, 1897. The latest records that I have seen refer to a moth taken at
  sugar near Chatteris <!-- Page 195 --><span class="pagenum" title="309.png"
  ><a name="page195"></a>{195}</span>in 1904, two caterpillars beaten out
  of hawthorn in August, 1905, and a moth on an ash tree, Wicken, July 31,
  1907. (Plate <a href="#plate100">100</a>, Fig. 7).</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is yellowish green, with a red brown stripe along the
  back; two small elevations on ring four, and one on ring eleven; the
  hairs are blackish on the back, one of each tuft longer than the others.
  It feeds on hawthorn in August and early September. The moth is out in
  July. This species is found abroad in Central Europe and Southern France;
  also in Amurland, Corea, and Japan.</p>

<h5><b>The Dark Dagger</b> (<i>Acronycta tridens</i>).</h5>

  <p>The English name of this moth is not very suitable, as in general
  colour it is often really paler than many examples of the next species.
  Specimens with a blackish cloud at the base, and a dark band-like
  suffusion on the outer margin of the fore wings are referable to var.
  <i>virga</i>, Tutt. It is widely distributed in England and Wales, but
  apparently not common; rare in Scotland and in Ireland. I am unable to
  indicate any character that will serve to distinguish this moth from the
  Grey Dagger. The moth flies in June; a second brood sometimes occurs in
  confinement in October. The caterpillars of the two species are very
  distinct. That of the present species is black, with a broad reddish
  stripe along the back, and one on each side; the first is interrupted
  with white, and the others with black; there is a black hump on the
  fourth ring, and a broader one on the eleventh ring. It feeds from August
  to October on hawthorn, sloe, plum, pear, and apple; also on birch and
  sallow.</p>

  <p>The moth is shown on Plate <a href="#plate100">100</a>, Fig. 10; and
  the caterpillar on Plate <a href="#plate101">101</a>, Fig. 4.</p>

<h5><b>The Grey Dagger</b> (<i>Acronycta psi</i>).</h5>

  <p>The ground colour varies from whitish to blackish grey, Var.
  <i>bivirgæ</i>, Tutt, is similar to var. <i>virga</i> of the last
  species. <!-- Page 196 --><span class="pagenum" title="310.png"><a
  name="page196"></a>{196}</span>In var. <i>bidens</i>, Chapman, the first
  cross line is double, enclosing a pale stripe; the upper part of second
  cross line is more angled, and the dagger mark at the anal angle is much
  shortened.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar has a taller and more slender hump on ring four, and
  the stripe along the back is clear yellow, with black edged red spots on
  each side of it. Generally distributed, and often common.</p>

  <p>The moth is shown on Plate <a href="#plate100">100</a>, Fig. 11; and
  the caterpillar and chrysalis on Plate <a href="#plate101">101</a>, Figs.
  5 and 5<i>a</i>.</p>

<h5><b>The Light Knot Grass</b> (<i>Acronycta menyanthidis</i>).</h5>

  <p>Portraits of this moth will be found on Plate <a
  href="#plate103">103</a>, Figs. 1&#x2642;, 2&#x2640;. Several
  modifications have been named, the most important of these are var.
  <i>scotica</i>, Tutt, which is larger and brighter than the type, with
  the markings clear and distinct; var. <i>suffusa</i>, Tutt, is much
  suffused with black. The former is chiefly found in Scotland, and the
  latter in Yorkshire.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is black or sooty-brown, with a red stripe, or
  blotches, low down along the sides; hairs black or red-brown. In August
  and September feeding by day on sweet-gale or bog myrtle (<i>Myrica
  gale</i>), bilberry, heather, dwarf sallow, etc. The moth flies in June
  and July, and may be found on the mosses and moorlands of North England
  and Scotland. It rests by day on rocks, stones, and, where they are
  handy, on posts and rails. I found several on Danes Moss, Cheshire,
  sitting on a derelict tub. Also occurring in Ireland, but not common.</p>

<h5><b>The Scarce Dagger</b> (<i>Acronycta auricoma</i>).</h5>

  <p>The pale grey, darker-mottled moth depicted on Plate <a
  href="#plate103">103</a>, Fig. 3, is very local, and only occurs in some
  of the woods of <!-- Page 197 --><span class="pagenum" title="311.png"><a
  name="page197"></a>{197}</span>Kent and Sussex; the districts mentioned
  being those of Rochester, Canterbury, Hailsham, and Hastings.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is figured on Plate <a href="#plate102">102</a>, Fig.
  2. It is slaty grey in colour with a black plate on the first ring; on
  the back of each ring is a broad black band, and four orange warts from
  which arise golden-yellow silky hairs; the hairs on the sides are pale
  drab (adapted from Buckler). It feeds in June and early July, sometimes
  in September, on oak, birch, various kinds of <i>Rubus</i>, such as
  blackberry and raspberry, and also on bilberry (<i>Vaccinium</i>). The
  moth is out in late April and in May; occasionally late July and in
  August. It is rarely seen in the day time, but has been found resting on
  tree trunks. The range abroad extends to Southern Russia and Siberia.</p>

<h5><b>The Sweet-Gale Moth</b> (<i>Acronycta euphorbiæ</i> var. <i>myricæ</i>).</h5>

  <p>Our form of this species&mdash;var. <i>myricæ</i>, Guenée (Plate <a
  href="#plate103">103</a>, Fig. 4), is rather larger and much darker than
  the type; but although it is generally somewhat smaller than the Alpine
  var. <i>montivaga</i>, Guenée, it is not otherwise separable from that
  form. So far as concerns the British Isles, it is only found in Scotland
  and, rarely, in Ireland. It was first obtained in Perthshire, in 1846, by
  Weaver, and it is now known to occur more or less commonly through
  Scotland from Ayr to Sutherlandshire. In Ireland it occurs in Cork,
  Kerry, Galway, and Sligo, and Kane considers that specimens from Markrea,
  and Lough Gill in the latter county are referable rather to var.
  <i>montivaga</i>, than to var. <i>myricæ</i>. The moth is out in April,
  May, and June.</p>

  <p>The dark greyish caterpillar has a deep black, broken, stripe along
  the middle of the back, and a series of pale yellow marks on each side of
  it; along the black-margined white spiracles there is a reddish orange
  line, or broken stripe; pale brownish hairs arising from yellowish warts
  on the back, and a cross-bar of reddish orange near the head. It feeds on
  sweet <!-- Page 198 --><span class="pagenum" title="312.png"><a
  name="page198"></a>{198}</span>gale, heather, birch, sallow, etc., and
  may be found from July to September. Two figures of it, from coloured
  drawings by Mr. Alfred Sich, will be found on Plate <a
  href="#plate102">102</a>.</p>

<h5><b>The Knot Grass</b> (<i>Acronycta rumicis</i>).</h5>

  <p>The ordinary form of this moth is shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate103">103</a>, Figs. 6&#x2642;, 7&#x2640;. The species varies
  greatly in the amount of dark mottling and clouding on the fore wings;
  sometimes this is much reduced, and the pale grey ground colour is then
  clearly seen; more often these wings are entirely clouded over with
  blackish or sooty brown, leaving only the white bracket-like mark above
  the inner margin, and the submarginal cross line, distinctly visible
  (var. <i>salicis</i>, Curtis). The moth flies in June and July, and
  sometimes in August and September.</p>

  <p>The hairy caterpillar, which is somewhat humped on rings four and
  eleven, is figured in Plate <a href="#plate102">102</a>, Fig. 1. It is
  dark brownish grey, marked on the back with a central series of black
  patches in which are reddish spots, and a row of white spots on each
  side; below the white spiracles is a yellowish wavy line with reddish
  warts upon it. Various low-growing plants, such as plantain, dock,
  sorrel, and also hawthorn, sallow, and bramble, afford it nourishment,
  and it is found in July, August, and September.</p>

  <p>Generally distributed throughout England and Wales, its range
  extending into Scotland as far north as Morayshire; also in Ireland. The
  var. <i>salicis</i> occurs northwards from Shropshire through northern
  England into Scotland, but is perhaps most common in Ireland.</p>

<h5><b>The Coronet</b> (<i>Craniophora ligustri</i>).</h5>

  <p>This is also the Crown Moth of Moses Harris, both English names
  referring to a fancied resemblance of the whitish or pale greyish mark,
  just beyond the reniform stigma, to a crown or coronet (Plate <a
  href="#plate103">103</a>, Fig. 5). The greenish or brownish-olive fore
  wings are subject to modification in the depth of tint; sometimes they
  are blackish in tone&mdash;var. <i>nigra</i>, Tutt, or dark
  olive-green&mdash;var. <i>olivacea</i>, Tutt. In both of these named
  forms the whitish markings are obscured, and in this respect they seem to
  be about identical with var. <i>sundevalli</i>, Lampa.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is bluish green above, and yellowish green below; a
  slender whitish line along the middle of the back, and a yellowish line
  on each side; the spiracles are reddish, and the raised spots, from each
  of which a single black hair arises, are black. It feeds in August and
  September on ash, and less frequently, perhaps, on privet. It is stated
  to eat hazel and alder, also.</p>

  <p>The moth flies in June and July, and its occurrence in any locality
  depends largely upon the presence of ash. Widely distributed throughout
  England, Wales, and Scotland to Ross-shire. In Ireland it has only been
  noted from a few localities in Co. Galway.</p>

<h5><b>Powdered Wainscot</b> (<i>Simyra</i> (<i>Arsilonche</i>) <i>albovenosa</i>).</h5>

  <p>In its typical form (Plate <a href="#plate103">103</a>, Fig. 10), the
  fore wings are whitish ochreous with the veins showing up white more or
  less clearly. A form with reddish ochreous fore wings has been named var.
  <i>ochracea</i>, Tutt; and another with silvery-white wings var.
  <i>argentea</i> by the same author. These seem to be identical with forms
  of this species named <i>flavida</i> and <i>albida</i> by Aurivillius
  some eight years earlier.</p>

  <p>The hairy caterpillar is blackish or dark grey brown freckled with
  black; two stripes along the back and one on each side are yellow,
  sometimes marked with orange; the warts are orange with pale, and a few
  black, hairs; head black, marked with yellowish. <!-- Page 200 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="316.png"><a name="page200"></a>{200}</span></p>

  <p>It feeds from July to September on the leaves of reeds, at night;
  hiding by day under leaves low down. The moth is out in June, but an
  autumn brood is sometimes obtained. It only occurs in fenland, chiefly
  Norfolk and Cambridgeshire.</p>

<h5><b>The Marbled Beauty</b> (<i>Bryophila perla</i>).</h5>

  <p>Typically the fore wings of this species are white, marbled with slaty
  grey, and with the stigmata dark grey (Plate <a href="#plate103">103</a>,
  Figs. 9&#x2642;, 12&#x2640;). There is less colour variation than in the
  last species, but in some localities greenish, ochreous, and ochreous
  brown forms have been obtained. The caterpillar is pale slaty grey, with
  an irregular yellowish stripe on the back, with black spots forming a
  central line; the raised spots are black and shiny, as also is the head.
  Feeds on lichens growing on old walls from August to May. The moth, which
  occurs throughout England, Wales, Ireland, and Scotland up to the Clyde,
  is to be found, commonly as a rule, on walls by day, and gas lamps at
  night, in July and August. Sometimes I have found specimens on tree
  trunks.</p>

<h5><b>Marbled Green</b> (<i>Bryophila muralis</i> (<i>glandifera</i>)).</h5>

  <p>Two forms of this very variable little moth are represented on Plate
  <a href="#plate103">103</a>, Figs. 8&#x2642; (typical), 11&#x2640;. The
  ground colour of the fore wings ranges from almost white through pale
  green to bluish green or to a deep olive green, or through pale ochreous
  to orange brown. The markings, too, vary in intensity, and are sometimes
  very obscure. Several forms have been named, but only the Cambridge race,
  known as var. <i>impar</i>, Warren, can here be referred to. In this form
  the colour is more often greyish or brownish white, than green; the
  markings are cloudy and not clearly defined.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is obscure greenish, with whitish and rather <!-- Page
  201 --><span class="pagenum" title="317.png"><a
  name="page201"></a>{201}</span>shining raised spots; there is a black
  plate on the first ring, and from this three broken yellowish lines run
  along the back. Head black and glossy. It feeds from October to May on
  the lichens growing on walls and rocks; during the day it hides in a
  chamber formed of silk and lichen, which is not easy to detect in dry
  weather. The moth is out in July and August, and at Eastbourne I have
  found it in September. It may be found generally on walls, but sometimes
  on rocks at various places on the coast of Kent, Sussex, Dorset, Devon,
  and Cornwall; also in the Scilly Isles. Its range, according to Barrett,
  extends to Bath and Wells, Somersetshire, Marlborough and Chippenham in
  Wiltshire, and it has also occurred in Gloucestershire.</p>

<h5><b>The Tree-lichen Beauty</b> (<i>Bryophila algæ</i>).</h5>

  <p>The only record of this species in England that I am aware of is that
  by Mr. Edleston, in the <i>Intelligencer</i> for 1860, p. 11, as follows:
  "Two specimens of this pretty species (<i>B. algæ</i>) were taken in this
  district last July." The district referred to was Manchester, and the
  note was written on September 28, 1859.</p>

<h5 class="lg125">TRIFINÆ.</h5>

<h5><b>The Turnip Moth</b> (<i>Agrotis</i> (<i>Euxoa</i>) <i>segetum</i>).</h5>

  <p>The ordinary form of the male and the female is represented on Plate
  <a href="#plate104">104</a>. The species is an exceedingly variable one,
  and Haworth (1803), believing them to be distinct species, gave Latin and
  English names to several of the different forms. The ground colour in the
  male ranges from pale whitish or brownish ochreous, with strong markings,
  to blackish brown, with the markings obscured. The female ranges in
  colour of <!-- Page 202 --><span class="pagenum" title="318.png"><a
  name="page202"></a>{202}</span>fore wings from greyish to blackish.
  Caterpillar, greyish brown, tinged with ochreous, or sometimes pinkish; a
  glossy plate on first ring, greyish or brownish; spots glossy, each with
  a tiny hair; lines rather darker, but often indistinct. It feeds from
  July to April on various plants, but only attacks the tender stems near
  the surface of the ground. In fields it is destructive to turnips and
  swedes, making large cavities in the bulb, which it enters from just
  above the tap-root. The moth flies in June, and occasionally as a second
  generation in the autumn. Generally distributed over the British Isles,
  and often very common. Its range extends throughout nearly the whole of
  Europe and the greater part of Asia.</p>

<h5><b>The Archer's Dart</b> (<i>Agrotis</i> (<i>Euxoa</i>) <i>vestigialis</i>).</h5>

  <p>The specimens shown on Plate <a href="#plate104">104</a> are typical
  of the sexes (Figs. 1&#x2642;, 3&#x2640;). The normal pale brown colour
  is sometimes replaced by greyish, reddish, or olive brown. A specimen
  with black fore and hind wings has been recorded from North Wales by Mr.
  Jäger. The markings vary in intensity, and occasionally are almost or
  quite absent. Several of the varieties have been named. The caterpillar,
  which feeds on bed-straw and various grasses, etc., is greenish grey,
  inclining to brownish above, with a dark-edged pale line along the middle
  of the back, and a similar line on each side; the raised spots are black,
  and the plate on first ring brownish; head ochreous, marked with darker.
  August to May. The moth is out in July and August, and is chiefly found
  on sandhills by the sea. It is most plentiful on the eastern and southern
  coasts, and in Cheshire, Lancashire, and Yorkshire: it is often not
  uncommon in the Brandon and Tuddenham districts, and others, in the
  "Breck Sand" area of Suffolk and Norfolk. The species has been recorded
  from Worcestershire, and I understand that a few specimens were taken in
  Surrey last August (1907). In Scotland it occurs on the east coast, and
  in the Orkney Isles; also in Ayr, on the south-west. In Ireland, also, it
  is found on suitable parts of the coast.</p>

<h5><b>The Heart and Club</b> (<i>Agrotis</i> (<i>Euxoa</i>) <i>corticea</i>).</h5>

  <p>The more usual form of the male and the female are shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate105">105</a> (Figs. 7&#x2642;, 8&#x2640;). The colour varies
  from pale brown to a whitish or greyish brown tint in one direction, and
  to reddish or blackish brown in another. The cross lines, generally well
  defined, are sometimes absent, or nearly so, in some of the pale forms,
  and much obscured in the dark forms. The black outlined reniform and
  orbicular stigmata are sometimes obscured by a blackish cloud; the
  pale-centred, club-like mark below them varies in length, and is
  occasionally reduced to a small spot. "<i>Noctua subfusca</i>," Haworth,
  has been determined by Mr. E. R. Bankes, who possesses the type, to be an
  obscurely marked fuscous &#x2642; example of this species. The greyish
  brown, rather rough-looking caterpillar, is freckled with a darker tint
  above, and inclined to greenish below; a fine, pale line along the middle
  of the back is edged with brownish, and on each side there is a pale
  line, edged above with brown, and below this a double pale line; head
  marked with blackish (Plate <a href="#plate109">109</a>, Fig. 1). It
  feeds from March to April, after hibernation, on various low-growing
  plants, including goose-foot (<i>Chenopodium</i>), persicaria, knotgrass,
  dock, and clover. The moth is on the wing in June and July, and very
  occasionally in September. It is rather a common insect in eastern and
  southern counties bordering the sea, but extends into Surrey, and
  occasionally into Cambridgeshire, Oxfordshire, and Berkshire; and is also
  found more or less frequently in Herefordshire, Warwickshire,
  Staffordshire, Cheshire, Lancashire, and Yorkshire. In Scotland it occurs
  in Ayr, and on the eastern side to Moray. It has been taken in various
  <!-- Page 204 --><span class="pagenum" title="322.png"><a
  name="page204"></a>{204}</span>counties, on the coast, of Ireland from
  Cork to Sligo, and from Wicklow to Derry.</p>

<h5><b>The Light Feathered Rustic</b> (<i>Agrotis</i> (<i>Euxoa</i>) <i>cinerea</i>).</h5>

  <p>Both sexes are shown in their typical forms on Plate <a
  href="#plate105">105</a>. The fore wings of the male (Fig. 9) are
  generally pale greyish in colour, with blackish cross lines and central
  shade; the claviform mark is absent, and the orbicular stigma usually so,
  or represented by a dusky dot; sometimes the ground colour is brownish,
  occasionally purplish grey, and very rarely black. The female (Fig. 10)
  is smaller, and always much darker.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is blackish green or dark greyish, with three fine
  pale lines, the central one edged on both sides, and the others edged
  above, with a darker tint; a pale stripe along the black spiracles; head,
  and plate on first ring black. It feeds on wild thyme, and is said to eat
  dock. It hatches from the egg in late June or early July, and presumably
  hibernates when full grown, as it does not seem to feed again when it
  reappears in early spring.</p>

  <p>The moth flies in May and June, and is only to be found on hills and
  downs in chalk or limestone districts. It occurs in Surrey, Dorset, Isle
  of Wight, Devon, Gloucestershire, Herefordshire, North Wales, Berkshire,
  Oxfordshire, Cambridge, and Suffolk; it seems to have been most
  frequently met with in Kent and Sussex. The small form, with narrow and
  distinctly marked fore wings, and whitish hind wings, occurring in the
  south of England, has been named var. <i>tephrina</i>, Staud.</p>

<h5><b>The Shuttle-shaped Dart</b> (<i>Agrotis</i> (<i>Euxoa</i>) <i>puta</i>).</h5>

  <p>As will be seen by the figures on Plate <a href="#plate104">104</a>,
  the sexes of this species also differ greatly in colour. Usually the
  cross lines on the fore wings of the male do not show up so distinctly as
  in <!-- Page 205 --><span class="pagenum" title="323.png"><a
  name="page205"></a>{205}</span>Fig. 2, which closely approaches a form
  figured and described as <i>radiola</i> by Stephens in 1829. Fig. 5
  represents the typical blackish-brown female. Gynandrous specimens, one
  side &#x2642; the other &#x2640;, have been recorded. The caterpillar
  feeds on dandelion, lettuce, knotgrass, and other low-growing plants,
  from September to April; probably full grown before hibernation. The
  moth, which is out in July and August, sometimes in May, is partial to
  low-lying, marshy ground and meadows, and is widely distributed over the
  whole of the south of England, but it is seemingly rare in the north, and
  still more so in Scotland and Ireland. Barrett states that it has been
  found commonly in Carmarthenshire, Wales.</p>

<h5><b>The Crescent Dart</b> (<i>Agrotis</i> (<i>Euxoa</i>) <i>lunigera</i>).</h5>

  <p>Although its position in classification is that of a local form of
  <i>A. trux</i>, Hübn., this moth, which is figured on Plate <a
  href="#plate105">105</a>, Figs. 1&#x2642;, 2&#x2640;, may here retain the
  name that was given to it by Stephens in 1829. Except that it has been
  reported to occur in the north of France, it seems to be peculiar to the
  British Isles. The earliest known specimens were captured near Cork in
  Ireland, June, 1826, and it is now found not only on the coasts of Cork
  and Kerry, but also on the Hill of Howth, near Dublin. In England it
  occurs in the Isle of Wight, Dorsetshire (Portland), Devonshire
  (Torquay), Cornwall, and the Scilly Isles. Reported from Sussex in 1918.
  In Wales it is to be found above Barmouth, and in various parts of South
  Wales; and in Scotland around Edinburgh and on the Moray coast. The moth
  is out in July and August. Mr. A. E. Gibbs, writing of this species in
  Cornwall, remarks, "It is generally stated that <i>A. lunigera</i> is
  only to be taken on steep and dangerous cliffs, in places where sugaring
  is by no means a safe occupation; but its abundance at Polzeath showed
  that this is not invariably the case. Here it was found on posts and
  flower heads in the valley at some <!-- Page 206 --><span class="pagenum" title="324.png"
  ><a name="page206"></a>{206}</span>distance from the seashore, and so
  abundantly did it occur that one evening's work yielded upwards of fifty
  specimens."</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is greyish or greenish grey, inclining to brownish
  above, and with darker brown marks on the back; lines paler, edged
  sometimes with darker grey; raised spots blackish, rather glossy; head
  brownish, marked with black, and the plate on first ring is black with a
  central yellow line. It feeds from August to May on various low plants
  growing in rocky places by the sea. Will eat dandelion, plantain, and
  knotgrass in confinement, also sliced carrot.</p>

<h5><b>The Coast Dart</b> (<i>Agrotis</i> (<i>Euxoa</i>) <i>cursoria</i>).</h5>

  <p>The specimens whose portraits will be found on Plate <a
  href="#plate106">106</a> are more or less typical of the sexes of this
  most variable species. The ground colour of the fore wings ranges from
  whitish ochreous through all shades of brown up to dark reddish, and from
  whitish grey through leaden grey to brown grey. The markings, too, are
  exceedingly variable; the cross lines are often faint, sometimes entirely
  absent; the stigmata are frequently obscure, and occasionally the
  blackish lower part of the reniform is the only indication of these
  marks. There is often a white streak along the costa, and in some
  specimens this is very conspicuous (Figs. 3&#x2642;, 4&#x2640;).</p>

  <p>The caterpillar feeds from September to June on various grasses
  growing on sandhills, and is said to eat wormwood and violet. It is
  ochreous in colour, more or less tinged with green; the lines are pale
  grey, edged with darker grey; spots brown, and head ochreous brown.</p>

  <p>The moth is on the wing from late July to early September, and is to
  be found on all the larger tracts of sandhills on the east coast from
  Suffolk northwards, and on the coasts of Cheshire and Lancashire. It is
  not common on our southern coasts, but occurs in Dorsetshire and Devon.
  In Scotland it is obtained <!-- Page 207 --><span class="pagenum" title="325.png"
  ><a name="page207"></a>{207}</span>on the Firth of Forth, Kincardine, and
  Aberdeen coasts, and also in the Hebrides, Orkney, and Shetland Isles;
  and on very many parts of the coast of Ireland.</p>

<h5><b>The Garden Dart</b> (<i>Agrotis</i> (<i>Euxoa</i>) <i>nigricans</i>).</h5>

  <p>This moth is typically sooty or blackish brown in both sexes (Plates
  106, Figs. 5&#x2642;, 6&#x2640;), but varies to pale brown, or through
  various shades of red brown. The markings, usually obscure, occasionally
  are well defined, and sometimes there are additional black spots and pale
  streaks. The caterpillar is pale or dark ochreous brown on the back,
  inclining to greenish on the sides; lines greenish grey, edged with
  black, and a double whitish one low down on the sides. It feeds from
  September to June, on clover, plantain, dock, and various other low
  plants; and also cow-parsnip and other umbelliferæ. The moth flies in
  July and August, and is to be found in most English counties, but perhaps
  most commonly in the eastern. In Scotland it ranges to Moray, and seems
  to be generally distributed in Ireland.</p>

<h5><b>The White-line Dart</b> (<i>Agrotis</i> (<i>Euxoa</i>) <i>tritici</i>).</h5>

  <p>This is another exceedingly variable species. The ground colour of the
  fore wings ranges from pale whitish or ochreous brown, through various
  tints of greyish and red brown, up to black or sooty brown; variation in
  markings is somewhat similar to that referred to in <i>A. cursoria</i>.
  Three forms are shown on Plate <a href="#plate106">106</a>, Figs. 7, 8,
  and 11; the latter represents a specimen closely approaching <i>A.
  obelisca</i>. Var. <i>aquilina</i> (Figs. 9 and 10), the English name of
  which is the Streaked Dart, is larger than the type, and the wings,
  consequently, are broader; by some entomologists it is considered to be a
  distinct species.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is obscure greyish or brownish, with a dark-edged pale
  line along the middle of the back, and a dusky line <!-- Page 208
  --><span class="pagenum" title="326.png"><a
  name="page208"></a>{208}</span>on each side of it; low down on the sides
  is another dusky line. It feeds from September to May on mouse-ear
  chickweed, bedstraw, plantain, and other low-growing plants growing on
  sandy soils.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in July and August, and is widely distributed
  throughout the British Isles, including the Orkneys and Shetlands, but
  especially common on coast sandhills.</p>

<h5><b>The Square-spot Dart</b> (<i>Agrotis</i> (<i>Euxoa</i>) <i>obelisca</i>).</h5>

  <p>The fore wings of this moth (Plate <a href="#plate106">106</a>, Fig.
  12) are pale greyish brown, purplish brown, or sometimes slaty brown,
  with fairly distinct black cross lines, and a pale streak along the front
  edge; the first line is straight and less angled, and the second line
  less curved towards the front margin than in <i>A. tritici</i>. The
  caterpillar, which feeds from about October to July on rock rose,
  bedstraw, and other low plants growing in rocky places by the sea or on
  hillsides, is very similar to that of the last species. The moth is out
  in August and September in its special haunts. A well-known locality for
  it is Freshwater in the Isle of Wight, but it may be obtained at Torquay,
  Devonshire; Padstow, Cornwall; and the Scilly Isles. Also recorded from
  Sussex, Gloucestershire, Herefordshire, South Wales, Derbyshire,
  Cheshire, Lancashire, and Yorkshire. In Scotland on the south-west and
  east coasts; and in Ireland at Howth, Dublin; Dungarvan, Co. Waterford;
  and Mt. Charles, Donegal.</p>

<h5><b>The Heart and Dart</b> (<i>Agrotis</i> (<i>Feltia</i>) <i>exclamationis</i>).</h5>

  <p>On Plate <a href="#plate105">105</a> are figured two examples of the
  male (Figs. 3, 4) and two female specimens (Figs. 5, 6). The colour of
  the fore wings ranges from pale whitish brown through various shades of
  brown and grey to a sooty brown or black. The cross lines are rarely very
  distinct, the reniform, orbicular, and claviform marks are, however,
  generally much in evidence; but either of the two last, sometimes both,
  may occasionally disappear. Not infrequently the reniform is connected
  with the orbicular by a black streak from the former; more rarely the
  claviform is much widened and lengthened, and almost united with a dusky
  cloud above it (var. <i>plaga</i>, Steph.). This species is sometimes
  mistaken for <i>A. corticea</i>, but apart from the shorter teeth of the
  male antennæ, the present species has a distinct, and often conspicuous,
  black mark on the front of the thorax.</p>

<p><!-- Page 209 --><span class="pagenum" title="329.png"><a name="page209"></a>{209}</span></p>

  <p>The caterpillar is brownish with darker pear-shaped marks on the back;
  lines dark edged; spiracles black and of large size. Head pale marked
  with brown. It feeds from July to May on various low herbage, including
  lettuce, chickweed, plantain, and goose-foot; also turnips.</p>

  <p>The moth flies in June and July (sometimes in September), and is
  generally common; but in Scotland it does not appear to extend north of
  Moray and Argyle.</p>

<h5><b>The Dark Sword Grass</b> (<i>Agrotis ypsilon</i>).</h5>

  <p>The sexes of this moth are represented on Plate <a
  href="#plate104">104</a>, Figs. 7 &#x2642; and 8 &#x2640;. In occasional
  specimens of the male the ground colour of the fore wings is rather pale
  brown; otherwise there is little variation to note. The caterpillar feeds
  from April to July on roots and leaves of cabbage, lettuce, goose-foot,
  and many low plants; also on swedes, mangold wurzel, etc. It is purplish
  or bronzy brown above and somewhat greener on the sides; the usual spots
  are blackish and the lines greyish edged with darker. Head black with two
  white spots. The moth is on the wing from July to September, and as it is
  sometimes seen in April and May and earlier, it is said to have probably
  hibernated. Possibly, however, such early specimens, found at least once
  in February, are immigrants. Sometimes the species is common and at
  others rare. It has occurred at one time or other almost everywhere in
  the British Isles, but it seems to be most regularly obtained in England
  and in Ireland. <!-- Page 210 --><span class="pagenum" title="330.png"><a
  name="page210"></a>{210}</span>Abroad its range extends through Europe,
  Asia, and North America, and also to Australia, and Honolulu.</p>

<h5><b>The Sand Dart</b> (<i>Agrotis</i> (<i>Lycophotia</i>) <i>ripæ</i>).</h5>

  <p>This species varies a good deal in the ground colour of the fore
  wings. According to Barrett it ranges from pure white through pale
  reddish, rich reddish (var. <i>desillii</i>, Pierret) reddish drab,
  yellowish drab, and various shades of pale brown to brownish grey, and
  the markings to all degrees of distinctness or obliteration, especially
  the latter. The two specimens on Plate <a href="#plate106">106</a> have
  the markings fairly well defined (Fig. 1 is a male, and Fig. 2 a
  female).</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is ochreous grey, whitish tinged with pink, or
  greenish; the lines and spots are greyish, and the spiracles large and
  black; head and plate on first ring ochreous brown. It feeds on saltwort
  (<i>Salsola</i>), sea rocket (<i>Cakile</i>), seablite (<i>Suæda</i>),
  sea holly (<i>Eryngium</i>), and various other plants that flourish on
  sandy shores. It is usually full grown in late autumn, when it goes down
  some depth into the sand, but does not pupate until the spring. If the
  caterpillars are not full fed when obtained they must be furnished with
  plenty of sand to burrow in, and kept supplied with slices of carrot
  until it is seen that the last put in remains untouched.</p>

  <p>The moth flies in June and July, and may be found on the coasts of
  Lincolnshire, Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex, Kent (Deal), Isle of Wight,
  Dorset, Devon (Dawlish and Torquay), Somersetshire, South Wales,
  Cheshire, Lancashire, and the Isle of Man. Rare in Scotland and in
  Ireland.</p>

<h5><b>The True Lover's Knot</b> (<i>Agrotis</i> (<i>Lycophotia</i>) <i>strigula</i>).</h5>

  <p>The white marked reddish moth (Plate <a href="#plate107">107</a>, Fig.
  1) frequents most of the moorlands and heath and ling-clad heaths and
  <!-- Page 211 --><span class="pagenum" title="331.png"><a
  name="page211"></a>{211}</span>commons throughout the British Isles. It
  varies in the tint of the reddish colour, and in the greater and lesser
  prominence of the white markings. Specimens from Scotland, especially
  from the Shetland Isles, are generally larger than English examples, and
  are often clouded with darker tints. The caterpillar, which is figured on
  Plate <a href="#plate109">109</a>, Fig. 4, is reddish brown with a pale
  line along the middle of the back edged with dark brown or blackish marks
  on each side; a whitish or pinkish white stripe along the sides with a
  brown edging above. Head ochreous brown, marked with darker. It feeds on
  heath and heather, and hides by day in the moss or among dead leaves,
  etc., below the food plant, August to May. The moth flies, sometimes by
  day, but usually at night, in June, July, and in late seasons in
  August.</p>

<h5><b>The Portland Moth</b> (<i>Agrotis</i> (<i>Lycophotia</i>) <i>præcox</i>).</h5>

  <p>The pretty greenish moth with black cross lines, white spots, and
  reddish-brown clouding on the outer area (Plate <a
  href="#plate107">107</a>, Fig. 4), is said to have been first reared in
  this country by the Duchess of Portland, early in the nineteenth century,
  hence the English name. Although occasionally found several miles from
  the sea, it is essentially a coast species, and may be obtained on the
  sandhills of Dorsetshire, Devon, Suffolk, Norfolk, Cheshire, Lancashire,
  Yorkshire, and the Isle of Man. Odd specimens occasionally occur inland,
  as for example at Kendal (1899), and in Worcestershire (1901 and 1903).
  In Scotland it is found in suitable places along the west coast, from the
  Firth of Clyde to Sutherland, and on the east to Moray; and it is widely
  spread on the coasts of Ireland. The caterpillar is slaty grey; central
  line on the back whitish or pale greyish, expanding on each ring and so
  forming a series of connected spots, edged with darker tint; then a
  whitish stripe, edged above by a slender black line; a whitish or bluish
  grey stripe along the black spiracles. Head pale <!-- Page 212 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="332.png"><a name="page212"></a>{212}</span>brown,
  obscurely marked with darker. It feeds from September to June on dwarf
  sallow, grasses, chickweed, wormwood, etc. The moth flies in August.</p>

<h5><b>The Pearly Underwing</b> (<i>Agrotis</i> (<i>Lycophotia</i>) <i>saucia</i>).</h5>

  <p>Two specimens, both males, are represented on Plate <a
  href="#plate104">104</a>. Fig. 10 is more or less typical and Fig. 9 is
  referable to var. <i>margaritosa</i>, Haworth; both occur together
  wherever the species is found, but the typical form is generally the most
  frequent.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar, which tapers slightly towards the head, is reddish
  grey or brown above and paler on the sides; a line along the middle of
  the back is yellowish and edged with dark brown dashes; the line along
  the greyish ringed black spiracles is pale and edged above with black; a
  yellowish blotch on the last ring and a black bar on ring eleven; head
  pale brown or greyish brown marked with black. It feeds on most low
  plants; also on cabbage and rape. It occurs in June and July, and in a
  second generation in September, October, and sometimes November. From
  eggs laid in September the caterpillar hatched in from five days to a
  fortnight and moths resulted from these about six weeks later.</p>

  <p>Although it certainly does occur in May and June sometimes, the moth
  is very much more frequently seen in autumn. On the south coast,
  extending to Cornwall and the Scilly Isles, the species is possibly a
  resident. In other parts of the British Isles its occurrence is more or
  less casual, and, although common in some years in other southern, and
  also eastern and northern counties, it does not seem to be permanently
  established therein. No doubt its more general distribution, and
  abundance here and there, in certain years, is due to the arrival of
  immigrants, either in small numbers in the spring, or in swarms later on
  in the year. <!-- Page 213 --><span class="pagenum" title="333.png"><a
  name="page213"></a>{213}</span></p>

  <p>The distribution abroad includes Central, Western, and Southern
  Europe; Asia Minor; Northern Africa, Canaries, and Madeira; North
  America.</p>

<h5><b>The Northern Rustic</b> (<i>Agrotis</i> (<i>Episilia</i>) <i>lucernea</i>).</h5>

  <p>The specimens of this locally variable species shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate107">107</a> are from Scotland (Fig. 9 &#x2642;), var.
  <i>renigera</i>, Stephens, and North Wales (Fig. 10 &#x2640;). Barrett
  (<i>Brit. Lep.</i>, vol. 3), discussing the variation, remarks, "On the
  south coast of England, and especially at Portland, the general tint is
  pale smoky grey, much darker towards the hind margin, and with the
  markings moderately distinct; inland mountainous districts, especially in
  North Wales, produce a still paler form; coast districts in the west and
  north a decidedly darker; and in the far west, as in Kerry, some
  specimens are actually slate-black, without more than the faintest trace
  of markings. The Isle of Wight produces deep slate-coloured specimens,
  darker than those from the Isle of Man, which are grey brown. Shetland
  specimens are large and dark, even to glossy blue-black." The caterpillar
  is dusky olive green, mottled all over with small black streaks and
  dapplings; each segment of the body having a faintly indicated pale
  olive-green spot on each subdorsal region, below which, on each side, is
  an oblique shading of blackish green. Head shining black-brown, rather
  lighter brown at the sides (Barrett). It feeds on harebell
  (<i>Campanula</i>), stonecrop (<i>Sedum acre</i>), saxifrage, cowslip,
  chickweed, and grasses, from August to May. The moth flies in July and
  August, and in the north and west in September. It occurs in rough stony
  places, on rocky places on the coast, and on hills inland, in Kent
  (Folkestone district), Isle of Wight, Dorset, Devon, Cornwall,
  Gloucestershire (rare), Sussex, Shropshire, Wales, Lancashire (rare),
  Yorkshire, and Westmoreland. It is widely distributed in Scotland and
  Ireland. <!-- Page 214 --><span class="pagenum" title="334.png"><a
  name="page214"></a>{214}</span></p>

<h5><b>The Dotted Rustic</b> (<i>Agrotis</i> (<i>Episilia</i>) <i>simulans</i>).</h5>

  <p>The sexes of this local moth are figured on Plate <a
  href="#plate107">107</a>. Fig. 7 represents a male from Aberdeen, and
  Fig. 8 a female from Dorsetshire. The latter is of a pale brown colour on
  the fore wings, and this is somewhat unusual, as the prevailing colour of
  specimens from the Dorset coast is greyish brown.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is ochreous brown, dotted with brown, and marked with
  dark brown, sometimes greenish tinged, on the back; a white stripe below
  the spiracles; head brown and rather glossy. It feeds on grasses and low
  plants, such as dock, dandelion, groundsel, etc. September to May. The
  moth flies in July, August, and September. It occurs at various places on
  the Dorsetshire coast; on the Cotswolds in Gloucestershire; in North
  Wales, and the Isle of Man; also from Cheshire to Cumberland. Widely
  distributed in Scotland, extending to the Hebrides and the Orkneys. In
  Ireland only recorded from Sligo.</p>

<h5><b>The Heath Rustic</b> (<i>Agrotis</i> (<i>Eueretagrotis</i>) <i>agathina</i>).</h5>

  <p>The moth, shown on Plate <a href="#plate107">107</a>, varies in colour
  and in marking. Fig. 2 depicts a specimen from Perthshire, and Fig. 3 one
  from North Devonshire. In Southern England the general tint is pinkish
  brown, and in the north and in Scotland it is dark reddish brown or
  blackish. A pale greyish form from Ireland has been named var.
  <i>hebridicola</i>, Staud. Sometimes specimens are distinctly rosy in
  tint, and these are referable to var. <i>rosea</i>, Tutt. The caterpillar
  (Plate <a href="#plate109">109</a>, Fig. 2) is reddish brown, or green,
  with whitish lines on the back, the central one edged on each sides with
  blackish, and the others inwardly marked with black; a yellowish stripe
  low down along the sides, sometimes marked with reddish; usual dots
  black; spiracles white, dark ringed; head greenish yellow marked with
  darker in the green form, and yellowish brown marked with darker in the
  brown form. It feeds from September to June on heath and heather. The
  above brief description was made from apparently full-grown caterpillars
  received from the New Forest on May 28, 1907, but not one of them
  attained the chrysalis stage. The moth is out in August and September,
  and occurs on most of the larger heaths, and on moorlands throughout the
  British Isles, including the Hebrides and Orkneys.</p>

<h5><b>The Stout Dart</b> (<i>Agrotis ravida</i> (<i>obscura</i>)).</h5>

  <p>The somewhat dingy brown, or greyish brown moth (Plate <a
  href="#plate107">107</a>, Figs. 5 &#x2642;, 6 &#x2640;) is sometimes
  tinged with reddish, and this tint is generally present on the front or
  costal area.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is ochreous brown with a paler line along the back,
  and a series of dark edged, oblique and more or less curved, yellowish
  marks on each side; head greyish freckled with brownish; plate on first
  ring brown marked with pale lines. It feeds on low-growing plants such as
  dock, dandelion, chickweed, etc.; September to May. The moth flies in
  July and August, but its occurrence in Britain is somewhat irregular. It
  is found, sometimes commonly, in most of the southern and eastern
  counties of England, and also in Durham; and has been occasionally
  recorded from other parts of the country, as well as from Scotland. For
  several years it may seem to quite disappear and then suddenly become
  common in various districts. Its range abroad extends to Amurland, North
  China, Corea, and Japan.</p>

<h5><b>The Northern Dart</b> (<i>Agrotis</i> (<i>Episilia</i>) <i>hyperborea</i>).</h5>

  <p>Of this pretty Scottish species (<i>alpina</i>, Westw. and Humph.)
  four examples are figured in Plate <a href="#plate108">108</a>. Figs. 1
  and 2 represent specimens from Shetland, and Figs. 4 and 5 are from
  Rannoch specimens. These will show something of the variation in this
  <!-- Page 216 --><span class="pagenum" title="338.png"><a
  name="page216"></a>{216}</span>moth, which was not known to occur in the
  British Isles until 1839, when a single specimen was taken on Cairn Gowr
  in Perthshire. No other example seems to have been noted up to 1854, when
  one was found on a rock in the same part of Perthshire. Up to the year
  1876, only a few specimens had been obtained, but in that year, which was
  a hot and dry one in the Highlands, quite a number were secured. A female
  was also detected laying her yellowish white eggs on crowberry
  (<i>Empetrum nigrum</i>) and thus gave a clue which led to the subsequent
  discovery of caterpillars and chrysalids; and these have been obtained in
  some quantity. The caterpillar is reddish, inclining to pinkish brown,
  freckled with darker; three whitish lines on the back, the central one
  irregularly black dotted, edged on both sides with black, and the others
  with black bars along their inside edge; head pale brown freckled and
  lined with darker brown. It feeds from August to June (of the second year
  following hatching from the egg, it is said), on crowberry, bilberry
  (<i>Vaccinium</i>), and bearberry (<i>Arctostaphylos uva-ursi</i>).</p>

  <p>The moth is out from late June until about the middle of August. It
  only occurs with us on the higher mountains in Perthshire, notably those
  to the south of Loch Rannoch; and at lower elevations in Unst, the most
  northern isle of the Shetland group. It has also been recorded from the
  Orkneys. Kane mentions a specimen bred at the end of February, 1893, at
  Clonbrock, Co. Galway, from a caterpillar found at a bog in the vicinity,
  where crowberry grows abundantly. Abroad the species in its typical form
  is found on mountains in Central and Southern Scandinavia, and in
  modified form in Silesia, Hungary, and Switzerland.</p>

<h5><b>Ashworth's Rustic</b> (<i>Agrotis</i> (<i>Episilia</i>) <i>ashworthii</i>).</h5>

  <p>This moth, which is figured in Plate <a href="#plate110">110</a>, is
  considered by some entomologists to be a form of <i>A. candelarum</i>
  peculiar <!-- Page 217 --><span class="pagenum" title="339.png"><a
  name="page217"></a>{217}</span>to the hills and mountains of North Wales,
  and found chiefly at Llangollen, Penmaenmawr, and Snowdon. The colour of
  the fore wings varies from pale dove colour to dark slaty grey. The
  caterpillar is blackish, or dark slate colour, with two series of velvety
  black spots, or dashes along the back; head reddish brown. It feeds on
  various low-growing plants, among which are rock-rose, wild thyme,
  sheep's sorrel, bedstraw, etc. Towards the end of April, in Flint, they
  feed freely and crawl about their food plants in the day time as well as
  at night (E. W. H. Blagg). The moth has been reared in November and
  December from eggs found in July, about the second week; the caterpillars
  having been supplied mainly with sallow, with the addition of dock,
  groundsel, plantain, and knot grass (R. Tait). On another occasion moths
  were bred in October from eggs laid by a female reared from caterpillars
  taken in North Wales in the spring (A. Harrison). The moth is out in July
  and August and in its rugged haunts, may be disturbed from among the
  loose rubble, and from chinks in the rocks; but as they come freely to
  sugared herbage, captives in this way would probably be more numerous.
  Discovered at Llangollen in 1853, by Mr. Joseph Ashworth after whom it
  was named by Doubleday in 1855.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Note.</span>&mdash;Barrett mentions the following
  Agrotids as having occurred in the British Isles.</p>

  <p><i>A. crassa</i>, Hübn., "one specimen in the cabinet of Mr. S.
  Stevens." <i>A. spinifera</i>, Hübn., a specimen taken in the Isle of
  Man, August, 1869. <i>A. fennica</i>, Tauscher, a specimen recorded in
  the <i>Zoologist</i> for 1850, as captured in Derbyshire.</p>

<h5><b>The Rosy Marsh Moth</b> (<i>Noctua</i> (<i>C&oelig;nophila</i>) <i>subrosea</i>).</h5>

  <p>The last two moths were respectively productions of Scotland and
  Wales; the present one is exclusively English, at least it was, because
  now and for perhaps the last fifty years it has been extinct in its old
  fenny haunts at Whittlesea, in Cambridgeshire, <!-- Page 218 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="340.png"><a name="page218"></a>{218}</span>and
  Yaxley, Huntingdonshire. In the latter fen it was first noted by Weaver
  about the year 1837. In 1846 and onwards it was plentiful, and the
  caterpillars were common. All was well with the species until about 1851
  when the fens were drained, and the moth then ceased to appear. (Plate <a
  href="#plate108">108</a>, Fig. 3.) In Sweden, Southern Russia, and in
  Amurland the species is represented by a bluish form, var.
  <i>subc&oelig;rulea</i>, Staud.</p>

<h5><b>The Double Dart</b> (<i>Noctua</i> (<i>Exarnis</i>) <i>augur</i>).</h5>

  <p>The dull brownish moth (Plate <a href="#plate110">110</a>, Fig. 6), is
  generally distributed throughout the British Isles, including the
  Orkneys. The fore wings of southern specimens are usually suffused with
  reddish, but this is less obvious in northern examples. The markings are
  sometimes bold and striking or, on the other hand, only faintly defined,
  or largely absent. A pinkish-tinged brown form without markings was
  formerly confused with the Continental <i>A. helvetina</i>. The moth is
  on the wing in June and July, sometimes in August, especially in the
  north; and the caterpillar is to be found from July to May. When young it
  feeds on various low-growing plants, but later it crawls up at night to
  devour the leaves of hawthorn, sloe, sallow, birch, etc. It is brownish,
  tinged with pink, and marked on the back with a series of V-shaped
  dashes, and white points; on ring eleven there is a yellowish-edged black
  mark; above the white spiracles is a black-edged red-brown stripe. Head
  pale brown, freckled with darker brown.</p>

<h5><b>The Autumnal Rustic</b> (<i>Noctua glareosa</i>).</h5>

  <p>In its typical form as depicted on Plate <a href="#plate110">110</a>,
  Fig. 4, this species is slaty grey with black markings. In Devonshire and
  other parts of the west of England, and also in Ireland, it assumes a
  decided pinkish tinge (var. <i>rosea</i>, Tutt). Through Scotland the
  colour becomes darker grey, and in Perthshire it merges into blackish
  grey. In the Shetlands a blackish, or sooty-brown form (var. <i>edda</i>,
  Staud.), occurs.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar feeds on grasses and various low plants, also on ling,
  heath, sallow, and has been found on wild hyacinth. It is yellowish-brown
  with dark shaded pale lines on the back, and a dark brown stripe on the
  sides; spiracles and dots blackish. October to June. The moth flies in
  August and September, and affects heathy places, borders of woods, etc.,
  throughout the British Isles, including the Hebrides, Orkneys, and
  Shetlands. Except in the New Forest, Hampshire, it does not seem to be
  common in the southern counties of England; it occurs in Epping Forest,
  and in other parts of the eastern counties; northwards it becomes more
  generally distributed and more plentiful.</p>

<h5><b>The Neglected, or Grey Rustic</b> (<i>Noctua castanea</i>).</h5>

  <p>The reddish typical form of this species is shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate110">110</a>, Fig. 3. Fig. 2 represents the greyish form,
  var. <i>neglecta</i>, which is most frequently met with in southern
  England. Between these extremes intermediate forms occur connecting one
  with the other. Specimens of a pale ochreous colour have been obtained in
  the vicinity of Market Drayton, Shropshire. The caterpillar, which feeds
  on heather and sallow at night, is pale reddish-brown, finely powdered
  with greyish; below the pale ochreous stripe on the sides, the ground
  colour is greenish; head marked with darker brown. September to May. The
  moth flies in August, and occurs on the larger tracts of heathery ground
  throughout the British Isles, but it is commoner in some parts than in
  others, and appears to be scarce in Ireland. The red form, and
  intermediates, occasionally occur in the New Forest, and also in other
  parts of Southern England, but in Scotland it is not uncommon. The
  distribution abroad is, like that of the last species, pretty much
  confined to Western Europe. <!-- Page 220 --><span class="pagenum" title="344.png"
  ><a name="page220"></a>{220}</span></p>

<h5><b>The Dotted Clay</b> (<i>Noctua baja</i>).</h5>

  <p>This species, a male and female of which are shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate114">114</a>, Figs. 7 &#x2642; and 8 &#x2640; is common in
  wooded districts throughout the British Isles, except the Orkneys and the
  Shetlands. The colour of the fore wings ranges from pale greyish brown,
  or reddish grey, to reddish brown or purplish brown. Sometimes the first
  and second cross lines are bordered, or represented, by pale bands.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is dingy ochreous brown, or reddish brown; three
  yellowish lines along the back, the central one edged with blackish; the
  others have blackish bordered yellow triangular marks between them, on
  each ring from three to eleven; spiracles and dots black; head pale
  brown, shining. It feeds in the autumn on various low plants, and in the
  spring on hawthorn, sloe, sallow, bramble, etc. September to May. The
  moth flies in July and August. Its range abroad extends to Amurland and
  to North America.</p>

<h5><b>The Plain Clay</b> (<i>Noctua depuncta</i>).</h5>

  <p>This species is represented on Plate <a href="#plate110">110</a>, Fig.
  5, by a female specimen. Sometimes the fore wings are more reddish brown
  in colour, and the markings are occasionally bolder. The caterpillar is
  pale or dark reddish brown above, and rather greyish below; the back is
  marked with dark outlined diamonds, and the dark edged white spiracles
  have a dark shade above them, and an ochreous stripe below; head pale
  brown marked with darker. Feeds on primrose, dock, sorrel, nettle, etc.
  from September to May. The moth flies in July, August, and the early part
  of September. It seems to be more frequently and regularly obtained in
  Scotland, especially in the woods of Perthshire, Aberdeen and Moray. In
  England the species is, or has been, found in Oxfordshire (rare in beech
  woods), <!-- Page 221 --><span class="pagenum" title="345.png"><a
  name="page221"></a>{221}</span>Berkshire, Wiltshire (Savernake Forest),
  Devonshire (Dartmoor), South Wales (near Swansea), North Wales (Mold),
  Cheshire (one specimen, Staley-brushes), Yorkshire (Scarborough), Durham
  (one at Bishop Auckland), Cumberland (Barrow Wood). The range abroad
  includes Central Europe (except Holland and Belgium), Southern Sweden,
  Lavonia, and South-east Russia, Armenia, and Northern Asia Minor. It may
  be noted that Stephens, writing in 1829, considered this to be a doubtful
  British species.</p>

<h5><b>The Setaceous Hebrew Character</b> (<i>Noctua c-nigrum</i>).</h5>

  <p>A male specimen of this often common and generally distributed species
  is shown on Plate <a href="#plate110">110</a>, Fig. 8. The fore wings
  vary in colour, from pale reddish grey through bright reddish or pinkish
  brown to purplish brown; the costal mark may be whitish, ochreous, or
  pinkish tinged. The moth is most frequently obtained in the autumn, but
  it is sometimes met with from May to July.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is pale brownish or greenish grey, with two series of
  black streaks, and a dark-edged pale central line, on the back; below the
  black outlined white spiracles is a black-edged yellow ochreous, or
  whitish stripe; head ochreous brown streaked with darker brown. It feeds
  on dock, chickweed, groundsel, and other low plants. It is said to feed
  from September to April or May. Possibly, however, in favourable seasons,
  some may pupate either in the autumn or in the early months of the year,
  and so attain the moth state greatly in advance of the majority. The
  range of this species' distribution extends to India, Corea, Japan, and
  North America.</p>

<h5><b>The Black Collar</b> (<i>Noctua flammatra</i>).</h5>

  <p>Fore wings pale greyish brown, with dark-edged pale cross lines; a
  pale whitish brown pink-tinged streak along the front <!-- Page 222
  --><span class="pagenum" title="346.png"><a
  name="page222"></a>{222}</span>margin to the second line; below this is a
  short black dot; the reniform and orbicular marks are pale, the centre
  sometimes darker, and the claviform has a dark edge but is not distinct;
  the front of the thorax is broadly marked with black, hence the English
  name.</p>

  <p>Only three British examples seem to be known; two of these were
  captured in the Isle of Wight, 1859 and 1876, and the third occurred in
  the lighthouse at Cromer in 1875. The range abroad is Central and
  Southern Europe, Western and Central Asia and India.</p>

<h5><b>The Triple-spotted Clay</b> (<i>Noctua ditrapezium</i>).</h5>

  <p>The ground colour of the fore wings of this moth ranges from pinkish
  brown through pale reddish brown to a purplish grey brown. The specimen
  shown on Plate <a href="#plate110">110</a>, Fig. 9 &#x2642; is of the
  pinkish brown form from Tilgate Forest in Sussex. In a series bred from
  caterpillars obtained at Hampstead, North-west London, the bulk of the
  males are pale reddish brown, and the females purplish brown; one male,
  however, is as dark as the females. Caterpillar, purplish brown, mottled
  above with dark brown; a thin white line, interrupted with black, along
  the middle of the back, and a row of black marks on each side; on the
  sides are oblique blackish marks, with the white spiracles showing
  distinct at their lower ends. Head pale shining brown, the cheeks marked
  with darker brown. Feeds on dandelion, dock, chickweed, primrose, and
  other low plants; also on bramble and sallow, and in the spring on the
  young leaves of birch. September to May (Plate <a
  href="#plate111">111</a>, Fig. 2).</p>

  <p>The moth flies, in and around woods, in July. It is local and not
  always common, but has been found in the north-west and south-west
  districts of London, Kent, Surrey, Sussex, Hampshire, Dorsetshire, Devon,
  Wales (Swansea and Barmouth), and Norfolk (Cromer). It occurs in Scotland
  (Perthshire), and <!-- Page 223 --><span class="pagenum" title="347.png"
  ><a name="page223"></a>{223}</span>two specimens have been recorded from
  Ireland. Its range extends to Siberia and Amurland.</p>

<h5><b>The Double Square-spot</b> (<i>Noctua triangulum</i>).</h5>

  <p>This species (Plate <a href="#plate113">113</a>, Fig. 1) is usually
  pale brown, more or less tinged with reddish, but some specimens are of a
  rather darker hue, and others inclined to greyish. The conspicuous marks
  in the discal cell, usually black or blackish, are sometimes pale or dark
  reddish brown. The moth flies in June and July, and occurs in woods or
  well-timbered districts throughout England (except in Somerset, Dorset,
  and westward), Wales, Scotland (mainland), and Ireland.</p>

<h5><b>The Square-spotted Clay</b> (<i>Noctua stigmatica</i>).</h5>

  <p>As will be seen from its portrait (Plate <a href="#plate113">113</a>,
  Fig. 2), this moth, although darker in colour, is marked somewhat
  similarly to the last referred to. It should be noted, however, that the
  basal line is less distinct; the submarginal line is inwardly shaded with
  blackish, and there is no blackish spot at its costal extremity. The fore
  wings are sometimes pale reddish brown, and sometimes almost
  blackish.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar, which is ochreous, or brownish, is somewhat similar
  in marking to that of <i>A. ditrapezium</i>, and feeds on dandelion,
  dock, chickweed, plantain, sallow, etc. In confinement it is said to eat
  sliced carrot or potato, and, if kept warm, may be induced to feed up and
  attain the moth state early in the year.</p>

  <p>The moth flies in July and August and seems to be partial to woods. It
  is very local, but occurs not uncommonly in the New Forest, Hampshire,
  and in Oxfordshire and Berkshire beech woods; also found in
  Buckinghamshire, the Eastern Counties, Kent, Sussex, Dorsetshire, Devon,
  Lancashire (once), Yorkshire (very local), and North Wales (once). In
  Scotland <!-- Page 224 --><span class="pagenum" title="348.png"><a
  name="page224"></a>{224}</span>it appears to be more widely spread, but
  has not been noted in Ireland.</p>

<h5><b>The Purple Clay</b> (<i>Noctua brunnea</i>).</h5>

  <p>The fore wings of this moth (Plate <a href="#plate113">113</a>, Figs.
  3, 4) range in colour from purplish brown to reddish brown, or pale
  reddish brown; some of the darker forms are suffused with greyish, and
  the central area is occasionally ochreous tinged. There is also variation
  in the markings, especially the reniform stigma which is usually more or
  less filled in with ochreous or whitish tint, but not infrequently it is
  merely outlined in one of these colours, and the centre is then dark grey
  brown, sometimes enclosing a whitish or ochreous crescent. These remarks
  are of general application, but refer to a long series I obtained in
  North Devon.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar (Plate <a href="#plate112">112</a>, Fig. 2) is reddish
  brown with a yellowish tinge and with black dots and ochreous markings.
  It feeds on bilberry, wood-rush (<i>Luzula</i>), various low plants,
  bramble, sallow, and in the spring it attacks the buds and young leaves
  of the birch saplings, etc. August to May. The moth flies in June and
  July, and is often common in woods over almost the whole of the British
  Isles, including the Hebrides and the Orkneys. The range abroad extends
  to Amurland.</p>

<h5><b>The Ingrailed Clay</b> (<i>Noctua primulæ</i>).</h5>

  <p>This species, long known as <i>festiva</i>, but for which Esper's
  earlier name <i>primulæ</i> will have to be adopted, is exceedingly
  variable. Specimens of the more or less typical form and also of the
  forms known as <i>conflua</i> and <i>thulei</i> are portrayed on Plate <a
  href="#plate113">113</a>. The fore wings range in colour from pale
  ochreous to chestnut brown, and from grey to smoky grey brown. The cross
  lines are distinct in some specimens, but in others are hardly visible;
  the discal cell is often no darker than the <!-- Page 225 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="349.png"><a name="page225"></a>{225}</span>general
  colour, but sometimes there is a reddish square spot in place of the
  usual black one; the reniform and orbicular marks may be only faintly
  outlined, and the latter sometimes cannot be traced; the brownish
  band-like shade between the outer and submarginal lines is frequently
  only indicated by a short dash from the front margin, and even this is
  occasionally absent.</p>

  <p>The smaller moorland and mountain form, var. <i>conflua</i>,
  Treitschke, and in the vulgar tongue The Lesser Ingrailed, varies on
  somewhat similar lines. (Plate <a href="#plate113">113</a>, Figs. 8, 9.)
  Var. <i>thulei</i>, Staudinger, also varies greatly in colour and in
  marking. Some specimens are dark reddish brown, or occasionally smoky
  brown; others are pale reddish brown, grey brown, reddish grey, or grey;
  the pale cross lines are generally distinct, in the darker specimens
  especially. This form, which is peculiar to the Shetland Isles, is shown
  on Plate <a href="#plate113">113</a>, Figs. 10, 11. In the foregoing
  remarks reference has been made only to the general trend of variation;
  many other forms of aberration in this species might be mentioned if
  space permitted.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is pale or dark reddish or olive brown inclining to
  pinkish between the rings; the lines are yellowish, the central paler
  edged with brown, and the outer ones edged with blackish marks; oblique
  darker dashes on the sides; spiracles black, ochreous ringed, with a pale
  stripe below them; head pale brown marked with darker. It feeds on
  primrose, bilberry, dock, sallow, hawthorn, bramble, etc. August to May.
  (Plate <a href="#plate112">112</a>, Fig. 1.) The moth flies in June, but
  specimens of a second generation have been obtained, in confinement, from
  August to October. The species in one form or another occurs in woods, on
  moorlands, etc., over the whole of the British Isles.</p>

<h5><b>The Barred Chestnut</b> (<i>Noctua dahlii</i>).</h5>

  <p>The sexes of this species are depicted on Plate <a
  href="#plate114">114</a>. It will be noted that the female (Fig. 2) is
  darker in colour than the <!-- Page 226 --><span class="pagenum" title="350.png"
  ><a name="page226"></a>{226}</span>male (Fig. 1). The sexual colour
  difference holds good generally, but there are exceptions and the male
  may sometimes be dark, like the female; or the latter sex may
  occasionally assume a reddish coloration. As a rule the reniform mark is
  most distinct in the female. A form occurring in Ireland with the fore
  wings dark sepia colour and the reniform mark clear whitish has been
  named var. <i>perfusca</i>, Kane. The caterpillar varies in the colour of
  the back through various shades of ochreous and brown to dark reddish
  brown, and this is always in strong contrast with the colour of the lower
  parts; the lines are pale, and the outer ones on the back are edged with
  black dashes; spots and spiracles black; head pale brown. It feeds on
  dock, plantain, etc., and in the spring on young sallow leaves. In
  confinement will become full grown before Christmas, but normally it
  feeds from September to May. The moth is out in late July and in August.
  It is found on heaths, moorlands, and in woods; it is not uncommon in
  some parts of the Midlands, and is found in Cheshire and northwards to
  Cumberland. It also occurs in Herefordshire, Pembrokeshire; in the south
  and east of England it is not frequent, but has been taken in South
  Oxfordshire, Berkshire (Newbury), Suffolk, Hants (Winchester and New
  Forest), etc. Widely distributed in Scotland, and locally abundant in
  Ireland. The distribution abroad extends to Amurland and Japan.</p>

<h5><b>The Small Square Spot</b> (<i>Noctua rubi</i>).</h5>

  <p>There are two generations of this species. The first is on the wing in
  June, and the second in August, September, and sometimes even in October.
  An example of each brood is shown on Plate <a href="#plate114">114</a>,
  Fig. 3, 1st gen., Fig. 4, 2nd gen. The early moths are larger in size
  than the later ones, but are fewer in number. Moths of the second
  generation often abound at the sugar patches, and on ragwort blossom. The
  colour of <!-- Page 227 --><span class="pagenum" title="351.png"><a
  name="page227"></a>{227}</span>the fore wings varies from pale to dark
  reddish brown in both broods.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is greyish ochreous or brown, with dark-edged paler
  lines, and the brown head is marked with darker. It feeds on dandelion,
  dock, grass, etc. Those of the first generation feed from autumn to
  spring, and those of the second during the summer. The moth is found in
  almost every part of the British Isles, except, perhaps, the Hebrides and
  Shetlands.</p>

<h5><b>The Six-striped Rustic</b> (<i>Noctua umbrosa</i>).</h5>

  <p>This species (Plate <a href="#plate114">114</a>, Fig. 5), is also
  generally distributed over our islands as far north as Moray, but it is
  rather partial to marshy situations. The caterpillar, which feeds from
  August to May on dock, plantain, bramble, bedstraw, etc., is pale
  ochreous or brownish, freckled with darker, and with dark-edged, pale
  ochreous lines on the back, the outer ones with a series of black wedges
  along them; a dark brown stripe low down along the sides; head pale brown
  marked with darker. The moth flies in July and August. It seems to prefer
  the flowers of the ragwort and the honey-dew on foliage to sugar, but the
  latter has attractions for it nevertheless.</p>

<h5><b>Cousin German</b> (<i>Noctua</i> (<i>Mythimna</i>) <i>sobrina</i>).</h5>

  <p>On Plate <a href="#plate114">114</a>, Fig. 6, is a portrait of this
  greyish suffused purple-brown species, which in the British Isles is
  seemingly confined to certain localities in Perthshire and Aberdeen, and
  was first met with in the former county by Weaver in 1853. According to
  Barrett it is found chiefly in mountain districts from 700 feet above
  sea-level upwards.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is reddish or red brown, slightly mottled with grey;
  the marking on the back almost linear, widening a little, but narrowly
  lozenge-shaped near the end of each ring, and <!-- Page 228 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="352.png"><a name="page228"></a>{228}</span>having
  on the widest part a round pale spot of dirty ochreous; sides much
  mottled with grey; dots and spiracles black, and under the latter a pale
  pinkish, ochreous, brown stripe; head shining brownish ochreous, with two
  black dots in front of each lobe. (Adapted from Buckler.) It feeds on
  heather, bilberry, birch, grass, etc. September to June. The moth flies
  in July and August.</p>

<h5><b>The Square-spot Rustic</b> (<i>Noctua</i> (<i>Segetia</i>) <i>xanthographa</i>).</h5>

  <p>Four examples of this very common and most variable species are shown
  on Plate <a href="#plate114">114</a>, Figs. 9-12. The colour of the fore
  wings ranges from whity brown, or drab, through various shades of
  grey-brown and red-brown to blackish. The more or less square reniform,
  and the orbicular, marks are subject to a good deal of modification; in
  some specimens they are whitish or ochreous and very conspicuous, and in
  others exceedingly faint or entirely missing; or the reniform may be well
  defined and prominent, and the orbicular absent; the cross lines are
  frequently obscure, except the dark-edged, pale submarginal, and this,
  too, may be wanting; occasionally there is a blackish shade between the
  stigmata and extending from the front to inner margins. The hind wings of
  the males are whitish, with a dark marginal border of variable width, but
  rarely, so far as I have noted, entirely absent; those of the females are
  uniformly darker.</p>

  <p>The full-grown caterpillar (Plate <a href="#plate112">112</a>, Fig. 3)
  is hardly separable from that of <i>N. umbrosa</i>, and feeds at the same
  date on low-growing plants, etc. The moth flies in August and early
  September. It is generally distributed throughout the British Isles, and
  is abundant pretty well everywhere.</p>

<h5><b>The Flame Shoulder</b> (<i>Noctua</i> (<i>Ochropleura</i>) <i>plecta</i>).</h5>

  <p>This moth (Plate <a href="#plate110">110</a>, Fig. 7) is also common,
  and generally distributed throughout England, Ireland, Scotland
  (mainland), and Wales. The fore wings are usually purplish brown, but
  sometimes they are palish red brown; the creamy stripe on the front
  margin is more or less sprinkled with scales of the ground colour,
  occasionally so thickly that these marks appear reddish in tint; there is
  often a pale, wavy submarginal line, and in some specimens a dusky second
  line can be detected; not infrequently there are traces of the claviform
  mark, but I do not remember ever seeing any indication of a first line.
  The hind wings are white, and frequently the fringes are pale pinky
  brown.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is brownish, varying from ochreous to reddish,
  freckled with darker; the broken lines on the back are pale, with dark
  edges, and there is a brown freckled, pale ochreous stripe along the
  sides; the usual spots are black, and the spiracles whitish, edged with
  brownish; head brown marked with darker. It feeds on various low plants,
  and also on lettuce, beet, etc., in gardens; there are certainly two
  broods in most years, one in the summer and the other in the autumn. The
  moth is out in May and June, and again in August and September. Specimens
  have also been taken in July, and occasionally in April. The species has
  a very extensive range abroad, extending to India, Corea, Japan, and
  North America.</p>

<h5><b>The Flame</b> (<i>Axylia putris</i>).</h5>

  <p>This species, which is depicted on Plate <a href="#plate132">132</a>,
  Fig. 13, is pretty constant in its pale coloration and darker markings.
  It is often common, and is widely spread throughout England, Wales,
  Ireland, and in Scotland up to Ross.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is greyish brown, mottled and dusted with blackish,
  chiefly so on the sides; the central line is darker but indistinct, and
  there is a yellow spot on each ring; a whitish line on each side of the
  central one is edged above with curved black dashes, and these are most
  distinct on rings four to ten; <!-- Page 230 --><span class="pagenum" title="356.png"
  ><a name="page230"></a>{230}</span>the eleventh ring is edged behind with
  ochreous; head dark brown; spiracles and raised dots blackish. (Adapted
  from Fenn.) It feeds on hedge bedstraw (<i>Galium mollugo</i>), dock,
  plantain, nettle, and many other low plants; also on lettuce. July to
  October. Generally the winter is passed in the chrysalis stage, and the
  moth comes out in the following June or July. Sometimes the moth has
  emerged in September.</p>

<h5><b>The Lesser Yellow Underwing</b> (<i>Triphæna</i> (<i>Agrotis</i>) <i>comes</i> = <i>orbona</i>).</h5>

  <p>This very variable species, of which the typical forms and two
  varieties are represented on Plate <a href="#plate115">115</a>, is to be
  found, often abundantly, almost everywhere in the British Isles, except
  the Shetlands.</p>

  <p>Apart from a form peculiar to Scotland, which will be separately
  referred to, the colour range of the fore wings is from pale
  ochreous-brown to a deep brown; in all shades there may be a tinge of
  reddish, or a suffusion of greyish. In Ireland and Scotland, and less
  frequently in England, a distinctly red form occurs. (Plate <a
  href="#plate115">115</a>, Fig. 7.) Then there is variation in the
  markings, and more particularly in the reniform and orbicular marks; both
  stigmata are, perhaps, rarely absent, but they are frequently very faint,
  and of the orbicular there is often not a trace. On the other hand, both
  may be filled up with dark brown, or blackish, and very conspicuous. The
  cross lines, and more especially the shaded submarginal, are usually
  pretty much in evidence, but these are apt to disappear entirely. The
  yellow hind wings are occasionally smudged with blackish towards the
  base; the central crescents vary in size, and somewhat in shape, and
  although sometimes greatly reduced, they are only rarely quite missing;
  the black band before the outer margin is also subject to modification in
  width and the regularity of its edges. <!-- Page 231 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="357.png"><a name="page231"></a>{231}</span></p>

  <p>Var. <i>curtisii</i>, Newman, was discovered in the Isle of Bute by
  Curtis in 1825, but until 1871, when Newman gave it the name it now
  bears, it had been known as <i>consequa</i>, the name assigned to it by
  Curtis when figured by him in 1831. The form is generally rather smaller
  than the type; the fore wings are rich reddish brown, clouded to a
  greater or lesser extent with blackish, and sometimes entirely suffused
  with that colour. The yellow ground of the hind wings is rarely quite
  free of black scales, but in some specimens they are so thick that the
  yellow is hidden. A specimen of this form is shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate115">115</a>, Fig. 8. It is found in the Orkneys,
  Sutherlandshire, Elgin, Inverness, Aberdeenshire; also in the Hebrides,
  and in the Isles of Bute and Arran.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar (Plate <a href="#plate118">118</a>, Fig. 2), is
  greenish ochreous varying to greenish brown; three yellowish lines on the
  back, the central edged with blackish and the others with dark oblong
  marks; spiracles white, edged with blackish, and below them an ochreous
  stripe; head grey brown marked with darker. It feeds on grass and most
  low plants from September to April. The moth is out in July and
  August.</p>

  <p>Abroad it occurs chiefly in Central and Southern Europe, but its range
  extends to Southern Scandinavia and eastward to Asia Minor and
  Armenia.</p>

<h5><b>The Lunar Yellow Underwing</b> (<i>Triphæna</i> (<i>Agrotis</i>) <i>orbona</i> = <i>subsequa</i>).</h5>

  <p>Two specimens of this species are shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate115">115</a>. Fig. 1 represents a specimen from Forres, in
  Scotland, and Fig. 2 an example from the New Forest, Hants.</p>

  <p>Although there is some variation in the colour of the fore wings
  (which ranges from pale greyish brown to dark reddish brown), and also in
  the intensity and clearness of the markings, this species is far less
  aberrant than that last referred to, and <!-- Page 232 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="358.png"><a name="page232"></a>{232}</span>from
  which it is at once separated by the black mark on the front margin,
  placed on the inner edge of the submarginal line. The caterpillar is
  distinguished from that of <i>comes</i> by the black-edged broader
  ochreous central line, and a series of black oblong spots on each side of
  it; the stripe under the spiracles is broad, and ochreous. It feeds from
  September to April on grasses and various low plants. The moth flies in
  July and August. The species is widely distributed in Scotland, and
  occurs in Unst, the most northern of the Shetland Isles. In England it
  occurs, or has been found, in Durham, Yorkshire, Worcestershire
  (Malvern), Herefordshire, Gloucestershire, Oxfordshire, Norfolk, Suffolk
  (not uncommon in the "Breck" district), Surrey, Sussex, Wilts, Hants
  (rather commonly in the New Forest), and the Isle of Wight. For Wales,
  Barrett states that it is rare in Pembrokeshire; and Kane mentions Co.
  Galway (four specimens), Killarney, and Lisbellaw for Ireland. The range
  abroad is somewhat similar to that of <i>comes</i>, but it extends
  further north in Scandinavia.</p>

<h5><b>The Large Yellow Underwing</b> (<i>Triphæna</i> (<i>Agrotis</i>) <i>pronuba</i>).</h5>

  <p>The colour of the fore wings of this common, and often abundant,
  species ranges through various shades of brown to dark purplish. In the
  typical form (Plate <a href="#plate115">115</a>, Fig. 3), the wings are
  of the paler shades, mottled with darker, and the thorax, except the pale
  front, agrees in colour with the darker mottling of the wings. Fig. 6
  shows the plain form (var. <i>innuba</i>, Treitschke), and it is in this
  form that the darkest colours appear; the thorax is always of the wing
  colour, and without the pale front. The black mark at upper end of the
  submarginal line is rarely absent, but I have a pale reddish-brown
  example of the <i>innuba</i> form without the mark. In the black-bordered
  yellow hind wings a central crescent is very <!-- Page 233 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="359.png"><a
  name="page233"></a>{233}</span>exceptional, but specimens in which it is
  more or less evident are not unknown.</p>

  <p>The eggs figured on Plate <a href="#plate118">118</a> were found in
  August, 1906, on a leaf of gladiolus in the garden. When first noticed
  they were of a pale creamy-white colour, but two days afterwards the
  upper half of the batch became purplish grey, and the caterpillars
  hatched out the following morning, when the other half had also changed
  colour, and the larvæ hatched next day.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar (Plate <a href="#plate118">118</a>, Fig. 1), is
  obscure brownish, sometimes ochreous or green tinged; with ochreous lines
  on the back, the outer ones edged with blackish bars on rings four to
  eleven; head pale brown marked with darker. It feeds from August to May
  on grasses and low plants, and is often a pest in the flower or vegetable
  garden. When eggs are obtained early, the caterpillars from them will
  sometimes attain the moth state in the same year. The moth flies in June
  and July, and has occurred in April, September, and October.</p>

<h5><b>The Broad-bordered Yellow Underwing</b> (<i>Triphæna fimbria</i>).</h5>

  <p>This is another species with variable coloured fore wings, and four
  examples of it are shown on Plate <a href="#plate116">116</a>. Pale
  ochreous brown and greyish brown is the most frequent colour, but various
  shades of greenish or olive brown are not uncommon. A dark reddish-brown
  form, known to collectors as the "mahogany form," seems to be somewhat
  rare. In the majority of specimens the basal third, and more or less of
  the central area adjacent to the second line seems to be the darkest
  coloured; but occasionally these parts are pretty much of the same tint
  as the rest of the wings.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar (Plate <a href="#plate118">118</a>, Fig. 4) is of a
  soft ochreous brown, sometimes red tinted, minutely dotted with blackish;
  the central line on the back is pale, and on each side are darkly-edged
  pale <!-- Page 234 --><span class="pagenum" title="360.png"><a
  name="page234"></a>{234}</span>oblique streaks; the white spiracles are
  followed by blackish marks; head brown freckled with darker. It feeds in
  the autumn on primrose, violet, dock, etc., and in the spring it seems to
  prefer the buds and young leaves of birch, sallow, bramble, hawthorn,
  sloe, chestnut, etc. The chrysalis, which also is figured, is dark
  reddish-brown, with two short anal spikes.</p>

  <p>This species occurs in June and July, and frequents woodland
  localities throughout England, Ireland, Scotland (up to Moray), and
  Wales.</p>

<h5><b>The Lesser Broad-border</b> (<i>Triphæna ianthina</i>).</h5>

  <p>Fore wings violet or purplish grey with blackish cross bands and
  brownish suffusion, the latter more especially on the basal area;
  reniform and orbicular stigma outlined in whitish. (Plate <a
  href="#plate116">116</a>, Fig. 3.) In another form the bands and
  suffusion are reddish-brown. The black clouding on basal area of hind
  wings sometimes extends further towards the marginal band. The
  caterpillar (Plate <a href="#plate118">118</a>, Fig. 3) is of a greenish
  tinged ochreous brown colour, with a pale central line and series of
  dusky dashes along the back, these dashes becoming blackish on the hind
  rings; the white spiracles are set in a blackish mark, and under them is
  a pale ochreous stripe. It feeds in the autumn on primrose, bramble,
  dock, etc., and in the spring on the young growth of sallow, elm,
  hawthorn, etc. The moth flies in July and August, frequenting lanes,
  hedgerows, and woods. It is pretty generally distributed throughout
  England, Wales, Ireland, and Scotland as far north as Moray.</p>

<h5><b>The Least Yellow Underwing</b> (<i>Triphæna interjecta</i>).</h5>

  <p>Fore wings, dull reddish brown with darker cross lines and shades,
  often faint. On the inner margin of the yellow hind wings, two dusky
  shades run from the border to the base; these <!-- Page 235 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="361.png"><a name="page235"></a>{235}</span>are not
  infrequently as black as the border, which is often broader than in the
  specimen shown on Plate <a href="#plate116">116</a> (Fig. 4). The
  caterpillar is ochreous brown dotted with black; on the middle of the
  back is a brown stripe enclosing a whitish central line. A brown stripe
  along the sides is edged above with whitish; the head is pale ochreous
  brown lined with darker. Stated by Barrett to feed on grasses and low
  plants, or, in the spring, on young shoots of sallow; said also to eat
  primrose and dock. September to May. The moth is out in July and August,
  and affects lanes and hedgerows. I have found it more frequently on
  flowers of ragwort, and on "honey-dew," than on the sugar patch; but have
  met with it occasionally darting along some particular bit of hedgerow,
  in the late afternoon. Although apparently uncommon in the Midlands, it
  occurs more or less freely throughout England to Durham. In Ireland it
  has been found in counties Dublin, Wicklow, Waterford, Cork, Louth,
  Westmeath, Galway (Kane), and, Barrett adds, Antrim.</p>

<h5><b>The Green Arches</b> (<i>Eurois prasina</i>).</h5>

  <p>This moth is shown on Plate <a href="#plate117">117</a>. When quite
  fresh the ground colour of the fore wings is a beautiful green, but this
  often fades after a time, and the wings then assume an ochreous hue. The
  cross lines are black relieved with whitish, and there is a whitish
  blotch on the second line touching the outer edges of the reniform
  stigma. The green colour varies in tint even when the insects are alive;
  and the black markings differ in intensity, being much stronger in some
  specimens than in others. The caterpillar is greyish brown, more or less
  tinged with violet; there are three fine whitish lines, and a series of
  blackish diamond-shaped marks on the back; the spiracles are white, and
  there is an ochreous stripe below them. It feeds on dock and other low
  plants, bramble, and in the spring on sallow shoots and the young growth
  of bilberry. July to April, or May. <!-- Page 236 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="362.png"><a name="page236"></a>{236}</span>The
  moth, which frequents woods; flies in June, but has been reared, as a
  second generation, late in the year. The species seems to be pretty
  generally distributed over England and Ireland, and is often common,
  especially in the south and east of the former country. From the Midlands
  northwards it appears to be less common, and its range more restricted.
  In Scotland it has been recorded from Roxburghshire (common at sugar in
  1898), the Clyde district, and, Barrett adds, Perthshire.</p>

<h5><b>The Great Brocade</b> (<i>Eurois occulta</i>).</h5>

  <p>On Plate <a href="#plate117">117</a>, Fig. 3 represents the typical
  grey form of this species, and Fig. 4 the black var. <i>passetii</i>,
  Thierry-Mieg. Intermediates occur connecting the melanic form with the
  type, and sometimes specimens are found of a paler hue than the type.
  Bred specimens occasionally have a rosy tinge, and this is then usually
  most in evidence between the first and second cross lines. The
  caterpillar is brown, with three ochreous lines on the back, the outer
  with dark oblique dashes on each ring; a whitish stripe along the
  spiracles is blotched with reddish, and edged above with black. It feeds
  in the autumn on dock, plantain, primrose, dandelion, etc., and in the
  spring on bramble, bilberry, sallow, heather, and birch, among other
  things. Usually it hibernates when small, but when kept indoors, and
  fairly warm, it can be induced to complete growth, and attain the moth
  state in October or later, sometimes even earlier. In the open the moth
  flies from the end of June to August.</p>

  <p>Scotland appears to be the British home of the species, and it is
  found in most woods throughout that country, including the isles, but it
  is rare in the Shetlands. It occurs in Durham (rare), and in Yorkshire
  was not uncommon at Everingham in 1897, and several were obtained at
  Middlesbrough in 1900. Further south its occurrence is even more casual,
  and the most recent captures I have any note of are, two specimens in
  Lincolnshire, August, 1896, and one each in Norfolk and North East
  London, August, 1900. Also recorded from Essex. Only two specimens are
  known from Ireland.</p>

  <p>The range abroad extends to Amurland, Corea, and to North America.</p>

<h5><b>The Silvery Arches</b> (<i>Aplecta</i> (<i>Mamestra</i>) <i>tincta</i>).</h5>

  <p>The moth represented on Plate <a href="#plate117">117</a>, Fig. 5, has
  the fore wings silvery grey clouded with brownish on the central area; or
  occasionally spreading over a larger portion of the wings, and sometimes
  purplish in tint. The caterpillar is brownish inclining to reddish,
  clouded on the back with paler and darker brown. The central line, which
  has a broken blackish edging, is only distinct on the front rings.
  Spiracles black; head pale brown marked with darker brown. In the autumn
  it feeds on low plants such as dock, plantain, etc.; but in the spring it
  is found at night on the young growth of birch and sallow bushes, and
  more rarely on hawthorn, and I believe, on bilberry. The moth which
  occurs in birch woods in June and July, is not uncommon in the south of
  England from Essex to Hampshire, and has been found in Dorset and
  Devonshire. It has also been obtained more or less frequently in
  Berkshire, Oxfordshire, Cambridgeshire (once), Huntingdon, Worcestershire
  (Wyre Forest and Malvern), Staffordshire (north), Lancashire
  (Witherslack), Yorkshire (Huddersfield, once), and Westmoreland. In
  Scotland it ranges on the west from Ayr to Argyllshire, but although
  local is more frequent in Perthshire, Moray, and Sutherland. Var.
  <i>obscurata</i>, Staud., is a form of this species occurring in Amurland
  and Southern Siberia.</p>

<h5><b>The Pale Shining Brown</b> (<i>Aplecta</i> (<i>Mamestra</i>) <i>advena</i>).</h5>

  <p>This moth (Plate <a href="#plate117">117</a>, Fig. 6) is pale reddish
  brown and glossy, especially on the outer area, on the fore wings. The
  caterpillar <!-- Page 238 --><span class="pagenum" title="366.png"><a
  name="page238"></a>{238}</span>is pale ochreous brown above, and
  inclining to greenish below; three dark-edged pale lines, and a series of
  dark diamond-shaped marks on the back. The usual dots are whitish
  encircled with blackish, and the blackish edged spiracles are reddish
  brown; head olive brown, and plate on first ring blackish with the three
  lines showing distinct. From July to September it feeds on various low
  plants, including rest-harrow, dandelion, and knotgrass, also on broom,
  bilberry (Barrett); and Newman mentions sowthistle (<i>Sonchus</i>) and
  lettuce. In confinement the moth sometimes emerges in the autumn, but in
  the open it flies in June and July. Flowers seem to have more attraction
  for it than sugar. I have taken it at the blossoms of wood sage, white
  campion, and woundwort (<i>Stachys</i>), and Barrett notes, bladder
  campion, viper's bugloss, and the martagon lily. The species is chiefly
  found, as regards England, in the southern and eastern counties; and in
  the Solway, Clyde, Forth, and Tay districts of Scotland. Louth is the
  only Irish county from which it has been reported. The range abroad
  extends to Amurland. In North America the species is represented by var.
  <i>purpurissata</i>, Grote.</p>

<h5><b>The Grey Arches</b> (<i>Aplecta</i> (<i>Mamestra</i>) <i>nebulosa</i>).</h5>

  <p>Grey of some shade is the more general hue of this species, but it
  varies in the West of England and in Ireland to white (var.
  <i>pallida</i>, Tutt), and this form is shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate119">119</a>, Fig. 3. In Cheshire (Delamere), Lancashire
  (Warrington), and South Yorkshire black or blackish forms occur, and two
  examples of this melanic race are portrayed on the plate, Fig. 4 being
  var. <i>robsoni</i>, Collins, and Fig. 5 var. <i>thompsoni</i>, Arkle.
  Over the greater part of England, and in Scotland, the greyish form is
  most frequently met with, but the white form has been found in
  Argyllshire and in Sutherland. The caterpillar is ochreous brown or
  brownish grey, with a series of diamond-shaped blackish marks, and a pale
  central line, on the back; <!-- Page 239 --><span class="pagenum" title="367.png"
  ><a name="page239"></a>{239}</span>the dots and the spiracles are black,
  each of the latter with a blackish streak in front of it. In the autumn
  it feeds upon dock and other low plants; but in the spring, when it is
  more easily found, the caterpillar eats the buds and young leaves of
  birch, oak, sallow, bramble, etc. The moth is out in June and July, and
  is not uncommon in woods. The black form seems to be peculiar to north
  England. In Amurland the species is represented by var. <i>askolda</i>,
  Oberthür, and in North America by var. <i>nimbosa</i>, Guenée.</p>

<h5><b>The Cabbage Moth</b> (<i>Barathra brassicæ</i>).</h5>

  <p>The darker markings of this very common greyish moth are often very
  obscure, but the white outline of the reniform stigma, and the white
  submarginal line are usually distinct. The caterpillar varies in colour,
  but generally is some shade of dull brown or greenish, with the usual
  dots greyish or green tinged. The central line on the back is dusky,
  speckled with white, and the stripe low down on the sides is yellowish,
  greenish, or dingy brown; head ochreous brown marked with darker or
  greenish. Although it is exceedingly partial to the cabbage and other
  plants of the kind, it will feed upon almost every sort of low herbage,
  wild or cultivated. Barrett states that it has been found feeding on oak.
  I have taken it from birch in the garden, and it is known to eat leaves
  of almost any tree or shrub that may be offered to it in confinement.
  July to October. The moth is out in June and July, and sometimes there is
  an emergence in September. The species occurs over the whole of the
  British Isles, and abroad its range extends to India, Amurland, and
  Japan. (Plate <a href="#plate120">120</a>, Figs. 3&#x2642;,
  6&#x2640;.)</p>

<h5><b>The Dot</b> (<i>Mamestra persicariæ</i>).</h5>

  <p>The striking feature of the bluish-black moth shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate120">120</a>, Figs. 1, 2, is the brownish centred white
  reniform <!-- Page 240 --><span class="pagenum" title="368.png"><a
  name="page240"></a>{240}</span>stigma. Except that the yellowish
  submarginal line is sometimes obscured, the species is very constant in
  the British Isles. Abroad, a form without the white mark is known as
  <i>unicolor</i>, Staud., and one or two examples have been recorded as
  occurring in England, two in 1895 said to have been reared by a northern
  collector from caterpillars obtained in the London district. The
  caterpillar figured on Plate <a href="#plate129">129</a>, Fig. 2, was
  pale green with darker green markings. In another form the colour is pale
  brown with the markings darker brown. It is found from August to October
  on all sorts of low plants, and in the garden, where it is often common
  in the suburbs of London, is very fond of the foliage of <i>Anemone
  japonica</i> and lupin, among other plants. The moth is out in July and
  August, but is not often common north of the Midlands, though it occurs,
  or has been found in almost all the counties of England. Its occurrence
  in Scotland seems to be doubtful, and Kane states that it is rare in
  Ireland, and almost absent from the northern counties. Its range abroad
  extends to China and Japan.</p>

<h5><b>The White Colon</b> (<i>Mamestra albicolon</i>).</h5>

  <p>Two specimens of this species are shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate120">120</a>, Figs. 7, 8. It will be noted that, except for
  the two white dots at the lower outer edge, the outline of the reniform
  mark is very obscure; these dots are placed one below the other, thus
  forming a <b>:</b>, hence the English name of the moth. Blackish
  specimens have been obtained on the east coast of Scotland.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is green or bluish grey, with a dark-edged pale
  central line; spiracles white, margined with black. Barrett states that
  it feeds in June and July, and probably as a partial second generation in
  September, on plantain, dandelion, and other low plants growing in sand;
  probably also on <i>Atriplex</i>, <i>Chenopodium</i>, and Cruciferæ; but
  it is a larva of secret habits and is very little known.</p>

  <p>The moth, which flies in May and June, and again in July and August,
  frequents sandhills on the west, especially those of Yorkshire,
  Lancashire, Cheshire, and Wales. In Norfolk and Suffolk it is found in
  the Breck Sand district as well as on the coast, and it also occurs on
  the coasts of Dorset, Somerset, Devon, and Cornwall, but seems to be
  uncommon in most of these counties. In Scotland it occurs in suitable
  parts of the east coast to Aberdeen, and on the west coast to the Clyde;
  and in Ireland on the coasts of Kerry, Louth, and Derry.</p>

<h5><b>The Bright-line Brown-eye</b> (<i>Mamestra oleracea</i>).</h5>

  <p>The English name of this very common moth (Plate <a
  href="#plate120">120</a>, Figs. 4, 5), applies to the majority of
  specimens, but now and then the ochreous, or yellow reniform stigma,
  referred to as the brown eye, is blurred and indistinct, and the white
  submarginal line may almost disappear. The ground colour of the fore
  wings ranges from reddish or purple brown to dark brown. The caterpillar
  (Plate <a href="#plate129">129</a>, Fig. 1), varies from green to light
  brown, sometimes the brownish forms are tinged with pink; the body is
  minutely dotted with white, and the usual dots are black; the spiracles
  are white, margined with black, and placed on the blackish edge of a
  yellow stripe; there are three greyish, but frequently indistinct, lines
  on the back. It feeds from July to September on most low plants, and is
  often found in abundance under spreading clumps of goose-foot
  (<i>Chenopodium</i>), and has been noted in profusion upon tamarisk
  growing by the sea. The moth flies in June and July, sometimes in the
  autumn. Except, perhaps, in the Hebrides, it has been found throughout
  the British Isles.</p>

<h5><b>The Light Brocade</b> (<i>Mamestra genistæ</i>).</h5>

  <p>The moth portrayed on Plate <a href="#plate121">121</a>, Fig. 1, is
  not given to much variation. The central area enclosed by the cross lines
  is <!-- Page 242 --><span class="pagenum" title="372.png"><a
  name="page242"></a>{242}</span>more or less clouded with reddish or
  purplish brown, not extending, as a rule, below the black bar between the
  lines, but sometimes the inner area is clouded with purplish from the
  second cross line to the base of the wing. The caterpillar is pale olive
  greenish above, with brownish and blackish diamonds or V-shaped markings;
  three lines on the back are dark-edged but indistinct; a cloudy line
  along the white spiracles. The colour varies from greenish to brownish
  grey or purplish brown, and all shades may occur in the same brood. It
  feeds in July and August on broom, dyer's greenweed (<i>Genista
  tinctoria</i>), persicaria, and other low plants. The moth is out in May
  and June, and may be seen in the daytime on palings and other kinds of
  fencing, and also on tree trunks. It occurs in England from
  Worcestershire and Northampton southwards, but seems to be rarely met
  with northwards. Four or five specimens were taken at electric light near
  Tarporley, Cheshire, about 1900 (Day's List). It has been recorded from
  Ayr, Argyll, and Paisley in Scotland, but its occurrence in Ireland is
  doubtful. The distribution abroad ranges to Eastern Siberia.</p>

<h5><b>The Dog's Tooth</b> (<i>Mamestra dissimilis</i>).</h5>

  <p>The example of this species shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate121">121</a>, Fig. 2, is of the reddish-tinged pale brown
  form from Essex; but in that county, and also in other parts of England,
  the fore wings are sometimes clouded with sooty-brown. In other forms the
  fore wings are purplish or reddish brown, and the markings may be very
  distinct, or much obscured. The caterpillar is greenish or brown,
  minutely dotted with white, and freckled with dark greyish; the usual
  dots are black; there are indications of darker lines on the back, but
  these are not always clearly defined; the white spiracles are set in the
  black interrupted edge of a yellowish stripe. It feeds in July and
  August, on dock, plantain, etc. The moth flies in June and July, and
  occasionally in the autumn. Its haunts are marshy places, especially on
  the coast, and mosses; and it is found in most of the seaboard southern
  and eastern counties, and more rarely inland. Recorded from Ayr and
  Kirkcudbright in Scotland; is widely distributed in Ireland, and not rare
  in Louth and Kerry.</p>

<h5><b>The Pale-shouldered Brocade</b> (<i>Mamestra thalassina</i>).</h5>

  <p>The whitish or creamy-white patch at the base of the reddish-brown
  fore wings is a noticeable feature of this moth (Plate <a
  href="#plate121">121</a>, Fig. 7), and is almost always present, even
  when the wings are darkened and the other markings more or less obscured.
  The W-like angles of the white submarginal line run through to the
  fringes. In some specimens the general colour is purplish brown, and in
  others greyish brown. The caterpillar is greyish-brown with a slight
  reddish tinge, and freckled with darker brown; the usual dots are black;
  central line dusky, a series of darker oblique dashes on each side of it;
  the line along the spiracles is rather broad and sometimes edged above
  with blackish. It feeds in August and September on dock, groundsel,
  honeysuckle, broom, sallow, hawthorn, apple, etc. The moth is out in
  June, earlier or later according to the season; sometimes it appears
  again in August or September. It may be found, commonly as a rule, in
  most woods over the greater part of the British Isles.</p>

<h5><b>The Beautiful Brocade</b> (<i>Mamestra contigua</i>).</h5>

  <p>The moth (Plate <a href="#plate121">121</a>, Fig. 6) has a pale patch
  at the base of the fore wing, but this is not so conspicuous as is the
  pale orbicular stigma, which is often united with a pale mark at its
  lower edge; another pale patch lies at the inner angle, and the whole
  area between the second cross line and the clouding on <!-- Page 244
  --><span class="pagenum" title="376.png"><a
  name="page244"></a>{244}</span>the outer margin may be pale. Sometimes
  these pale markings are tinged with pink, and more rarely the whole
  surface is pinkish suffused. The caterpillar is yellowish-green with
  reddish V-shaped marks on the back; a yellowish line along the
  black-margined white spiracles. Buckler figures a reddish-brown form,
  with a yellowish stripe below the spiracles. It feeds in August and
  September on birch, oak, golden rod, bog myrtle (<i>Myrica gale</i>),
  dock, brake-fern (<i>Pteris aquilina</i>), etc. The moth appears in June,
  and may sometimes be seen in the daytime on tree trunks or palings. It is
  a woodland species, but although it occurs in most southern and eastern
  counties, it is not common in any of them; it becomes commoner in the
  Midlands, but is scarce in, or absent from, the northern counties of
  England, and in Wales. In Scotland it is more frequent in some localities
  from Argyll to Ross. Kane notes it as local, and sometimes abundant, but
  from the localities given it would seem to be widely distributed in
  Ireland. The range abroad extends through Northern Asia to Japan.</p>

<h5><b>The Broom Moth</b> (<i>Mamestra pisi</i>).</h5>

  <p>The moth shown on Plate <a href="#plate122">122</a>, Figs. 1, 2 varies
  considerably, in the colour of the forewings ranging from purplish red to
  dingy ochreous brown or greyish brown. The cross lines and occasionally
  the stigmata and shades may disappear, but the yellow submarginal line
  always remains, at least in part. The caterpillar (Plate <a
  href="#plate129">129</a>, Fig. 3) feeds on the foliage of a variety of
  plants including brake fern or braken, sweet gale, broom, bramble, wild
  rose, and sallow, and may be found, often in the daytime, in August and
  September. It is usually of some shade of green or brown, occasionally
  blackish, with yellow stripes. The moth is out in June and July and is
  more or less common almost throughout the British Isles. The range abroad
  extends to Amurland.</p>

<h5><b>The Nutmeg</b> (<i>Mamestra trifolii</i>).</h5>

  <p>The fore wings of this species (Plate <a href="#plate122">122</a>,
  Figs. 3, 4) are usually greyish brown variegated with darker; cross lines
  pale with black edging. Sometimes the general colour is tinged with
  ochreous. The caterpillar is green with a darker central and two whitish
  lines on the back, the outer lines with black marks on them; a white
  edged pinkish stripe along the black-margined white spiracles. It feeds
  from July to September, sometimes earlier or later, on goose-foot, orach,
  beet, and other Chenopodiacæ, and has also been found on young leaves of
  onion. The moth is out in May and June, and as a second generation in
  late July and August. In 1903 a specimen was taken, at Boscombe, on March
  21. The species is more especially attached to the coast, but is
  plentiful in the Breck Sand district of Norfolk and Suffolk, in market
  gardens and waste places around London, and is found more or less
  frequently up to Staffordshire. In Cheshire and Yorkshire it is scarce.
  Barrett states that in Scotland it is found rarely in Roxburghshire and
  Aberdeenshire; and not very uncommonly in the Clyde Valley; it is,
  however, not mentioned in the list of the lepidoptera of the Clyde area
  published in 1901. Only two specimens have been recorded from Ireland.
  The range abroad includes Northern Asia, Canada, and the United States of
  America.</p>

<h5><b>The Glaucous Shears</b> (<i>Mamestra glauca</i>).</h5>

  <p>Noticeable features of this dark-clouded whitish grey species (Plate
  <a href="#plate122">122</a>, Figs. 5&#x2642;, 6&#x2640;) are the whitish,
  or whitish outlined, stigmata; and the conspicuous black wedges on the
  inner edge of the pale submarginal line. The ground colour is sometimes
  purplish tinged; the dark clouding may spread over the greater part of
  the fore wings. The caterpillar is dark red brown with darker freckles, a
  whitish central line, and two <!-- Page 246 --><span class="pagenum" title="380.png"
  ><a name="page246"></a>{246}</span>series of dusky dashes; a paler line
  along the black-edged white spiracles; head pale brown freckled with
  darker. Feeds in July and August on heather, sallow, bog myrtle, etc.,
  and will thrive on lettuce. The moth is out in May and June, and may be
  found resting by day on tree trunks, fences, or rocks. This species in
  England occurs chiefly in hilly districts of the northern counties from
  Staffordshire to Cumberland; recorded from Glamorgan. In Scotland it is
  widely distributed from Ayr to Ross, and is also found in the Hebrides
  and the Orkneys; and in Ireland is obtained in several of the northern
  counties, and on the Hill of Howth. The range abroad extends to
  Amurland.</p>

<h5><b>The Shears</b> (<i>Mamestra dentina</i>).</h5>

  <p>The ground colour of this species, three specimens of which are shown
  on Plate <a href="#plate122">122</a>, Figs. 7, 8&#x2642;, 9&#x2640;,
  ranges from the normal pale grey through various shades of brownish grey.
  The markings, usually well in evidence, are sometimes obscured in the
  darker specimens. The caterpillar is brownish with three white lines and
  a series of grey-brown diamond-pattern blotches on the back; the outer
  lines with blackish spots upon them; the stripe along the black spiracles
  greyish; head pale brown marked with blackish; plates on first and last
  rings of the body glossy. Feeds in July and August on dandelion,
  knotgrass, chickweed, hawk's-beard (<i>Crepis</i>), hawkweed
  (<i>Hieracium</i>), etc. The moth flies in May and June and appears to be
  found throughout the British Isles. Represented in Siberia by the dark
  form <i>latenai</i>, Pierret.</p>

<h5><b>The Stranger</b> (<i>Mamestra peregrina</i>).</h5>

  <p>This species, which is an inhabitant of Asia Minor, Southern Russia,
  Turkey, Dalmatia and Northern Italy, occurs in Southern, Western, and
  Northern France; and three specimens <!-- Page 247 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="381.png"><a name="page247"></a>{247}</span>have
  been recorded as taken in England&mdash;all at Freshwater in the Isle of
  Wight&mdash;the first in 1858, the second in 1859, and the third about
  1876. The specimen depicted on Plate <a href="#plate122">122</a>, Fig.
  10, was received from abroad.</p>

<h5><b>Barrett's Marbled Coronet</b> (<i>Dianth&oelig;cia luteago</i>, var. <i>barrettii</i>).</h5>

  <p>The type, which is of ochreous coloration, does not occur in the
  British Isles, although in one example of var. <i>barrettii</i>, reared
  by Mr. Kane, a faint ochreous tinge was apparent, but this faded out in a
  few weeks. Fig. 2, Plate <a href="#plate123">123</a>, represents a
  specimen, kindly lent by Mr. R. Adkin, of var. <i>barrettii</i>,
  Doubleday, a form discovered in Ireland, at Howth, by the late Mr. C. G.
  Barrett, in June, 1861. In 1879 a specimen was taken on the coast at
  Ilfracombe, North Devon; one example was reared from a caterpillar found
  at Tenby, South Wales, in 1884, and one was captured in Carnarvonshire,
  North Wales, in 1897. In the last mentioned year specimens were taken by
  the late Major Ficklin on the coast of Cornwall, and as the Cornish form
  differs from the Irish form in being grey instead of brown, it has been
  named var. <i>ficklini</i>, Tutt. A second specimen was obtained in North
  Wales in 1899. Since its first detection at Howth the insect has been
  taken in limited numbers almost every year; and in 1906 Major C. Donovan
  recorded it as widely distributed along the coast of Co. Cork, the
  specimens being large, of a dark slate colour with distinct light whitish
  grey markings.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is pale ochreous with a pinkish tinge; the central
  line is greyish brown and the spiracles black; head reddish brown marked
  with darker. It feeds on the roots of seaside campion (<i>Silene
  maritima</i>), July to September. The moth flies from June to August.
  Like most of the species in this genus, it does not care for the
  collector's sugar, and except <!-- Page 248 --><span class="pagenum" title="382.png"
  ><a name="page248"></a>{248}</span>that an occasional specimen may be
  found resting on the rocks, the moths must be netted as they fly at dusk
  to the flowers of <i>Silene</i>. Staudinger considers that var.
  <i>barrettii</i> is identical with var. <i>argillacea</i>, Hübn.</p>

<h5><b>The Grey</b> (<i>Dianth&oelig;cia cæsia</i>).</h5>

  <p>The obscurely marked slate grey insect shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate124">124</a>, Fig. 5, was first found at Tramore, Ireland,
  and in the Isle of Man about the same year (1866 or 1867). Kane mentions
  that he has found the insect at Tramore, and also in eleven other
  localities on the rocky coast line of the South of Ireland, from Hook
  Point to Dingle Bay. Our form of the species, var. <i>manani</i>,
  Gregson, differs from the greyish blue continental type in its darker
  coloration, and this is intensified in the south-west corner of Ireland
  where specimens of a uniform bluish black occur.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is pale ochreous brown minutely freckled with darker;
  the lines on the back are blackish, but indistinct; usual dots margined
  with black; head pale brown, marked with darker. It feeds on the buds,
  flowers, and seeds of campions (<i>Silene maritima</i> and <i>S.
  inflata</i>) from June to August. The moth flies in June, July, and early
  August, and may be taken, like the last species, at the flowers of the
  campions growing on the rocks in its seaside haunts.</p>

<h5><b>The Marbled Coronet</b> (<i>Dianth&oelig;cia conspersa</i>).</h5>

  <p>Three forms of this locally variable species are shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate123">123</a>. Fig. 6 represents the typical form occurring
  generally in England, but in North Devonshire, on the coast, specimens
  are found closely approaching the Isle of Lewis form (Fig. 7), whilst
  others from that district agree in the blackish ground colour with
  specimens from Ireland. A still darker <!-- Page 249 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="383.png"><a name="page249"></a>{249}</span>race
  occurs in the Shetland Isles, and chiefly on the east coasts, whence came
  the specimen depicted (Fig. 8). On the western sides of the Shetlands,
  Mr. McArthur found the species to be rather more typical as a whole,
  although some specimens approached the darker eastern form. The dark
  Shetland race has been named var. <i>hethlandica</i> by Staudinger, and
  the form with the white markings yellowish tinged is var. <i>ochrea</i>,
  Gregson.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is pale ochreous brown; the back sprinkled with
  darker, and forming still darker V-shaped marks, central line pale;
  spiracles ochreous with black outlines, set in the upper edge of a pale
  stripe; head shining pale yellowish-brown freckled and lined with darker.
  It feeds on the seeds of catchfly, campion, and will eat those of
  sweet-william and garden pinks. July to September. The moth is out in
  June and July, and at dusk visits the flowers of its food plants, and
  occasionally comes to sugar. It is chiefly found in the seaboard
  counties, but as regards England is commoner in the south than in the
  north. Although generally rare in the inland counties, it is sometimes
  not uncommon in some Surrey localities, such as the Croydon district, and
  Mr. Scollick has reared moths from caterpillars found in seed capsules of
  white campion at Horsley.</p>

  <p>The distribution of this species extends to Amurland.</p>

<h5><b>The White Spot</b> (<i>Dianth&oelig;cia albimacula</i>).</h5>

  <p>The moth shown on Plate <a href="#plate124">124</a>, Fig. 1, is "The
  Beautiful Coronet" of some writers. Although a specimen was taken in Kent
  in 1816, nothing further was heard of the species in England until 1865,
  when one example was captured in the Portsmouth district. Then in 1873
  caterpillars were found in the Birchwood locality where the first moth
  was secured. The next year the species was found to occur at Folkestone,
  and subsequently at other places along the Kentish coast. Since <!-- Page
  250 --><span class="pagenum" title="384.png"><a
  name="page250"></a>{250}</span>1889 it has been obtained, not uncommonly,
  at Seaton on the South Devon coast. The caterpillar, which is somewhat
  similar to that of the last species, feeds in July and August on the
  seeds of the Nottingham catchfly (<i>Silene nutans</i>), but will thrive
  on those of other kinds of catchfly, campion, or even sweet-william and
  garden pinks. The moth flies in May and June.</p>

<h5><b>The Varied Coronet</b> (<i>Dianth&oelig;cia compta</i>).</h5>

  <p>In Europe this species has a less northerly range than <i>D.
  conspersa</i>, and its eastward range extends to Japan. The caterpillar
  feeds on the seeds of <i>Dianthus</i>.</p>

  <p>In his list of the lepidoptera of Ireland (<i>Ent. Mo. Mag.</i>,
  1866), Birchall remarks: "A pair of this well-known species, taken in
  Ireland by Mr. Tardy, are in the collection of Trinity College, but I am
  unable to indicate the exact locality of their capture." This is probably
  all the evidence we have of the occurrence of this species in the British
  Isles. The specimen represented on Plate <a href="#plate124">124</a>,
  Fig. 2, is from the Continent.</p>

<h5><b>The Lychnis</b> (<i>Dianth&oelig;cia capsincola</i>).</h5>

  <p>Except that the brown ground colour is sometimes of a reddish shade,
  or greyish in tone, there is not much to notice in the variation of this
  species. Occasionally the outlines of the reniform and orbicular marks
  are usually white and distinct, and now and then the black markings are
  intensified. Two specimens are shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate124">124</a>, Figs. 3 &#x2642;, 4 &#x2640;. The caterpillar
  is brownish ochreous freckled with darker, and with a pale central line
  and a series of dusky V-shaped marks on the back; a paler stripe along
  the whitish spiracles; head pale reddish brown, marked with darker brown.
  It feeds in July, sometimes in September, on campion, ragged robin,
  catchfly, and sweet-william and pinks. Fig. 3, Plate <a
  href="#plate130">130</a>, is from a coloured drawing <!-- Page 251
  --><span class="pagenum" title="385.png"><a
  name="page251"></a>{251}</span>by Mr. A. Sich, and represents the
  caterpillar, as seen when making the sketch, holding a seed between its
  front pair of legs and up to its mouth. The moth is out in May and June,
  and in some years there is a second flight in the autumn. The species is
  more or less common over the greater part of the British Isles.</p>

<h5><b>The Campion</b> (<i>Dianth&oelig;cia cucubali</i>).</h5>

  <p>This moth (Plate <a href="#plate124">124</a>, Figs. 5 &#x2642;, 6
  &#x2640;) is very similar to the last, but it has a distinct violet
  tinge, the orbicular mark is lengthened, and its lower edge touches, or
  almost touches, the reniform; the second line is distinct and straighter
  above the inner margin. The caterpillar is greenish, tinged with
  orange-brown on the front rings; the central line is greyish-brown, and
  the V-marks on the back and oblique stripes low down on the sides are
  orange-brown. It feeds on the leaves as well as the unripe seeds of
  campion, ragged robin, and catchfly in July, August, and September. The
  moth is out in June, and examples of a second generation in August. Like
  the rest of the species of the genus, it is most partial to flowers, but
  it occasionally puts in an appearance at the sugar patch. Pretty
  generally distributed over the British Isles. The range abroad extends to
  Amurland, China, and Japan.</p>

<h5><b>The Tawny Shears</b> (<i>Dianth&oelig;cia carpophaga</i>).</h5>

  <p>This species ranges in the colour of the fore wings from almost white,
  through various shades of ochreous brown.</p>

  <p>The white and ochreous-tinted specimens are found in Kent and Sussex
  chiefly, whilst the ochreous-brown forms are more generally distributed
  in England. Barrett states that in the south of Scotland a form occurs in
  which the ground colour is very pale dull brown with all the darker
  markings and cloudings deep umberous, the cloudings more extended. Var.
  <i>capsophila</i> <!-- Page 252 --><span class="pagenum" title="386.png"
  ><a name="page252"></a>{252}</span>(The Pod Lover), which represents the
  species in Ireland and the Isle of Man, is of a greyish coloration and
  lacks the ochreous tint; the dark markings, especially on the area
  between the first and second cross lines, are blackish or black, and the
  outlines of the stigmata are very distinct. Kane mentions dull black
  specimens, from the Blasket Islands, in which only vestiges of the
  stigmata and submarginal line remained clear. Pembrokeshire specimens
  have a colour range intermediate between <i>carpophaga</i> (Plate <a
  href="#plate124">124</a>, Fig. 9) and var. <i>capsophila</i> (Figs. 7,
  8), and serve to connect one with the other. The caterpillar, which is
  purplish brown with rather broad ochreous-brown lines on the back, feeds
  in June and July and again in September, on seeds of catchfly, campion,
  and sweet-william. The moth flies in May and June, sometimes in late July
  and August.</p>

<h5><b>The Viper's Bugloss</b> (<i>Dianth&oelig;cia</i> (<i>Epia</i>) <i>irregularis</i>).</h5>

  <p>The earliest British specimen of this moth (Plate <a
  href="#plate125">125</a>, Fig. 1) of which there is any clear record is
  that found by the late Rev. A. H. Wratislaw, in July, 1868, resting on
  viper's bugloss (<i>Echium vulgare</i>), in a locality about ten miles
  from Bury St. Edmunds. Subsequently Tuddenham was indicated as the
  locality, and there, as well as in other parts of the Breck Sand district
  of Suffolk and Norfolk the species continues to flourish. <i>Echium</i>
  was at first supposed to be the food plant, but it was soon ascertained
  the larval pabulum was the flowers and seeds of the local catchfly
  (<i>Silene otites</i>). In September, 1870, Mr. Porritt described the
  caterpillar, and he found that in confinement it did not object to Ragged
  Robin (<i>Lychnis flos-cuculi</i>) in place of the <i>Silene</i>.</p>

  <p>In colour the caterpillar is pale yellowish brown, tinged with green;
  three more or less distinct pale lines, and a series of smoke-coloured
  V-shaped marks on the back. Spiracles black with a yellowish white stripe
  below them, and a smoke-coloured one above; head wainscot brown dotted
  with black. It may be found on its food plant from late July to early
  September. The moth flies in June and July, but seems to have been very
  rarely met with in the open, although large numbers of the caterpillars,
  which are frequently "ichneumoned," are collected almost every year. A
  specimen, recently presented to the Lincoln Museum, is said to have been
  reared from a caterpillar found on viper's bugloss in the neighbourhood
  of East Ferry in North Lincolnshire.</p>

<h5><b>The Small Ranunculus</b> (<i>Hecatera chrysozona</i>).</h5>

  <p>Except that the general grey coloration of the fore wings of this moth
  (Plate <a href="#plate125">125</a>, Fig. 2) may be whiter or of a darker
  grey tint, there is little in the way of variation to refer to. Usually
  the area between the cross lines is dark grey, sometimes marked with
  yellow on the reniform and towards the inner margin. A series of yellow
  dots on the submarginal line is almost always present, but may be absent.
  The caterpillar is pale reddish brown; three fine double blackish lines
  and two rows of black dots on the back; a fine blackish line along the
  black spiracles. Head pale brown and glossy. In another form the general
  colour is some shade of green; yellowish to olive. It feeds in July and
  August on the flowers and seeds of the wild lettuce (<i>Lactuca
  saligna</i>, and <i>L. virosa</i>), hawk's-beard (<i>Crepis</i>), and
  also on those of the garden lettuce. The moth is out late in June and
  July, and at dusk may be seen at the blossoms of various plants in
  gardens and elsewhere, but seems to be most partial to those of
  spur-valerian (<i>Centranthus ruber</i>). It is found in the eastern
  counties, especially in Cambridgeshire; Surrey, and (rarely) in Sussex
  and Dorsetshire. Other English counties in which it has been noted are
  Hertford, Huntingdon, Northampton, Oxford, Berks, Somerset, and Hereford.
  <!-- Page 254 --><span class="pagenum" title="390.png"><a
  name="page254"></a>{254}</span></p>

<h5><b>The Broad-barred White</b> (<i>Hecatera serena</i>).</h5>

  <p>Most of the British examples of this species have the thorax and fore
  wings almost pure white, the latter with a central blackish grey band
  (var. <i>leuconota</i>, Ev., Plate <a href="#plate125">125</a>, Figs.
  3&#x2642;, 4&#x2640;). The white, however, especially on the outer
  margin, is sometimes clouded with greyish, and occasionally the ground
  colour has a greyish tinge, thus approaching var. <i>obscura</i>,
  Staudinger. The caterpillar is ochreous brown, more or less tinged with
  green, minutely dotted with dark grey, forming indistinct blotches; the
  stripe along the black spiracles is yellow tinged with green below. Head
  brownish, glossy. It feeds in July and August on hawk's-beard
  (<i>Crepis</i>). The smaller caterpillars may be found by day resting on
  the yellow flowers. In confinement they will eat the flowers and seeds of
  garden lettuce; and Prout mentions dandelion blossoms, and also those of
  almost any of the Compositæ. The moth is out from June to August, and in
  the daytime may be seen sitting on fences, tree trunks, rocks and walls.
  It is pretty generally distributed in the southern portion of England,
  but becomes scarce northwards. In Scotland it seems to be little known,
  but Renton records it as common in Roxburghshire, and in 1898 Mr.
  Kirkaldy kindly gave me three greyish-shaded specimens that he picked up
  casually at Pitlochry, Perthshire, in July of that year. It has been
  found in North Wales, but is more frequent in the southern parts of that
  country. Rather local and usually scarce in Ireland; but has been found
  in counties Waterford, Dublin, Wicklow, Louth, Antrim, Westmeath, Galway,
  Cork, and Kerry. The range abroad extends to Siberia and Amurland.</p>

<h5><b>The Bordered Gothic</b> (<i>Neuria reticulata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The cross lines and the veins are pale brown, sometimes tinged with
  pink. These markings give the moth (Plate <a href="#plate126">126</a>,
  Figs. 1&#x2642;, 2&#x2640;) a netted appearance, which, apart from the
  different ground colour and clouding, distinguishes it from the Gothic,
  with which it is sometimes confused. The antennæ, too, of the male are
  only fringed with minute hairs, whilst those of the male Gothic are
  broadly pectinated. The caterpillar is greenish or pinkish ochreous,
  mottled with darker, and with slightly paler lines on the back and sides;
  head light brown. It will feed in July and August on knot-grass; and
  soapwort (<i>Saponaria</i>), <i>Silene inflata</i>, and <i>Dianthus</i>,
  have been mentioned as food plants. The moth is out in June and July. The
  species occurs in nearly all the counties of England to Yorkshire, but
  except in Cambridgeshire, and perhaps Oxfordshire, it is not common in
  any of the southern or eastern counties, although more frequently found
  in them than northwards. It has not been recorded from Scotland, and
  seems to be rare in Ireland, as it has only been noted from Co. Dublin
  and Co. Cork.</p>

<h5><b>Feathered Gothic</b> (<i>Tholera</i> (<i>Epineuronia</i>) <i>popularis</i>).</h5>

  <p>The male of this species (Plate <a href="#plate127">127</a>, Fig. 3)
  is strongly attracted by light, and frequently seen in houses, and is no
  doubt a familiar object to most residents in the country, and even in the
  suburbs of London. The female (Fig. 4) does not visit light, but this
  sex, and the males also, may be found sitting after dark upon the upper
  erect leaves of the hard grasses, such as the matweed (<i>Nardus
  stricta</i>). Of course a lantern will be required to throw a light on
  the business of collecting them, and it is curious to note that even the
  brilliant glare of the acetylene lamp does not seem to disturb the moths
  very much, if at all.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is dark greenish brown and rather glossy, with a dusky
  plate on the first ring upon which are traces of the five dark-edged pale
  brownish stripes which traverse the body and meet on the last ring; the
  latter has a black plate. The spiracles are black, and the head is
  brownish, marked with <!-- Page 256 --><span class="pagenum" title="394.png"
  ><a name="page256"></a>{256}</span>darker. The caterpillars hatch in the
  spring from eggs laid the previous autumn, and may be found until July.
  They feed at night on the leaves of grasses, especially <i>Nardus</i> and
  such kinds, growing in parks and open places. The moth is out in August
  and September, and occurs more or less commonly throughout England and
  Wales. In Scotland it is found in Ayrshire, and in other localities in
  the Clyde area; thence eastward to Aberdeen. Kane states that in Ireland
  it is generally distributed, and in some localities very abundant, as at
  Clonbrock, and on the Wicklow coast.</p>

<h5><b>The Hedge Rustic</b> (<i>Tholera cespitis</i>).</h5>

  <p>The sexes of this moth are depicted on Plate <a
  href="#plate128">128</a>, Figs. 8&#x2642;, 9&#x2640;. In habits, and also
  in the kind of places it frequents, this species has much in common with
  that last mentioned. It is certainly more local, but its range in the
  British Isles is somewhat similar to that of the Gothic. The life history
  also is very like that of the last species, and the caterpillar feeds on
  the same kinds of grass.</p>

<h5><b>Antler Moth</b> (<i>Cerapteryx</i> (<i>Charæas</i>) <i>graminis</i>).</h5>

  <p>This moth (Plate <a href="#plate127">127</a>, Figs. 8&#x2642;,
  9&#x2640;) has the fore wings greyish brown or reddish brown, sometimes
  tinged with ochreous in the paler forms, or with olive in the darker
  forms. There is also variation in the markings, and chiefly of the
  central forked streak which has been likened to the antler of the stag.
  In most British specimens of the greyish form this is white throughout
  its length, and it has three branches; the stigmata are whitish, and
  there is often a whitish bar below the central streak. A number of
  aberrations have been named, and of these the following seem to be the
  most important: var. <i>tricuspis</i>, Esp., reddish brown; branched
  streak, stigmata, and bar ochreous; var. <i>rufa</i>, Tutt =
  <i>tricuspis</i>, Hübn., as above, but the markings white; var.
  <i>ruficosta</i>, Tutt = <i>graminis</i>, Hübn., greyish brown, with
  reddish front margin, and ochreous markings; var. <i>hibernicus</i>,
  Curt., yellowish brown with the markings ochreous, and the stigmata more
  or less united with the central streak. In some specimens most of the
  markings are obscured or absent, and only the reniform stigma and the
  forked extremity of the central line remain distinct.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar, which is glossy, and the skin much wrinkled, is of a
  bronzy-brown colour, with black-edged pale lines; there is a brownish
  plate on the first ring and a blackish one on the last; the spiracles are
  black and the head is brownish, marked with darker. It feeds from March
  to June on grasses, and in some years and localities occurs in enormous
  numbers, denuding considerable areas of grass land. Rooks and other birds
  devour them readily, and where their feeding places are on hillsides,
  they are apt to be washed off by heavy rain, so that the drains and
  ditches become filled up in places by masses of these caterpillars. Even
  after such wholesale destruction, the moths may still appear in the
  autumn in countless numbers. The male moths are sometimes seen flying in
  the sunshine and visiting the flowers of thistles, ragwort, etc. Such
  flight usually takes place between eight a.m. and noon, but both sexes
  have been seen flying over grass and heather continuously from just
  before midday to four p.m. The moths are also on the wing at night, and
  the male is very susceptible to the attraction of light. The species has
  occurred in all parts of the British Islands, but its presence in the
  south of England would appear to be more casual than elsewhere. The range
  abroad extends through Northern Asia to Siberia.</p>

<h5><b>The Feathered Ear</b> (<i>Pachetra leucophæa</i>).</h5>

  <p>Stephens, in 1829, figured one of two specimens of this species said
  to have been taken near Bristol in 1816, a part of England <!-- Page 258
  --><span class="pagenum" title="398.png"><a
  name="page258"></a>{258}</span>from which no other specimen has ever been
  recorded so far as I am aware. In June, 1855, the late Mr. S. Stevens
  obtained a few specimens at sugar, at Mickleham, Surrey. Between the year
  last mentioned and 1894 five other specimens have been recorded from the
  same county, these are Redhill (W. R. Jeffrey), Boxhill (G. Elisha, a
  pair, and B. A. Bower), Reigate (R. Adkin). In Kent, specimens have been
  found in the Folkestone and Tunbridge districts, but the chalk downs
  between Ashford and Wye appear to be the headquarters of the insect in
  Britain.</p>

  <p>A portrait of a male specimen will be found on Plate <a
  href="#plate128">128</a>, Fig. 1, but the ground colour is much whiter in
  the majority of British specimens.</p>

  <p>According to Dr. Chapman, the caterpillar varies from a nearly uniform
  nankeen-yellow with the markings only indicated, to a handsome larva with
  distinct black stripes. There is a pale dorsal line, quite narrow; thence
  to the black spiracles is divided into three longitudinal stripes, a dark
  dorsal, a dark (but less dark) lower one and a pale intermediate. In all
  these the ground colour is the same, nankeen-yellow, and the darker areas
  depend on the greater or less darkness of fine black mottlings, generally
  in fine wavy streaks running more or less longitudinally. The head is
  rather brown than yellow, mottled in a honey-comb pattern, with some
  black marking about the mouth parts. It feeds at night from July to March
  on various grasses, but seems to prefer <i>Poa annua</i>, and <i>P.
  nemoralis</i>. Dr. Chapman reared some of these caterpillars by keeping
  each individual in a separate glass jar and supplying it at frequent
  intervals with a fresh tuft of <i>Poa annua</i>. The moth is out from May
  to July, and hides during the day among the tufts of grass on chalk
  hills. It comes freely to sugar, and has been taken at privet
  blossom.</p>

<h5><b>The Silver Cloud</b> (<i>Xylomania conspicillaris</i>).</h5>

  <p>Three forms of this species occur with us. In that represented on
  Plate <a href="#plate128">128</a>, Fig. 4, the fore wings are almost
  entirely <!-- Page 259 --><span class="pagenum" title="399.png"><a
  name="page259"></a>{259}</span>blackish. Another has a larger portion of
  the inner marginal area ochreous brown, or whitish, ab. <i>melaleuca</i>,
  Vieweg; a third form, and the least frequent, may be described as pale
  ochreous brown with darker mottling on the basal half, and black central
  markings representing a broken streak from the base of the wing to the
  outer margin, in this form the pale outlined stigmata are fairly
  distinct, and there is a blackish shade between them extending from the
  front to the inner margin. From chrysalids obtained by digging under oak
  and elm trees in a private park several miles from Taunton, Somerset, Mr.
  H. Doidge (1901) reared moths and obtained eggs which were laid in a
  batch on the covering of the cage in which the female was placed with a
  growing plant of bird's-foot trefoil. The eggs hatched on May 31, ten
  days after they were laid. The young caterpillars were purplish grey, but
  after feeding on the yellow flowers they assumed the same colour. "After
  finishing the flowers they commenced on the leaves, by which time they
  were a pale green colour, with a yellow spiracular stripe, and were fond
  of resting by day on the stems of the plant. As they approached the final
  stage, the green became shaded with brown and black," and then resembled
  the ripening seed pods. They were afterwards supplied with blackthorn,
  and did not object to the change of food. They also ate dock (sparingly),
  and <i>Trifolium minus</i>. "About July 8 they began to go under ground
  to pupate. The pupæ, which were of a dark reddish-brown colour, and
  somewhat obese and blunt, being enclosed in a very compact and brittle
  earthy cocoon" (Doidge).</p>

  <p>The moth is out in April and May, but is very local in England. It has
  occasionally been found at rest on isolated tree trunks or on posts, but
  very rarely captured in any other way. Specimens have been obtained from
  chrysalids dug up now and then from about the roots of trees, but perhaps
  most of the specimens in collections, not numerous altogether, have been
  reared from eggs. In England the species is only known <!-- Page 260
  --><span class="pagenum" title="400.png"><a
  name="page260"></a>{260}</span>to occur in Kent, Surrey, Suffolk,
  Gloucester, Somersetshire, Worcestershire, and Herefordshire. Barrett
  also mentions one specimen at Gower, South Wales.</p>

<h5><b>The Beautiful Arches</b> (<i>Eumichtis</i> (<i>Hadena</i>) <i>satura</i>).</h5>

  <p>Of this species (Plate <a href="#plate121">121</a>, Fig. 5) probably
  less than a dozen specimens have been taken in England, and apparently
  none in any other part of the British Isles. It is very similar to some
  of the darker forms of <i>E. adusta</i>, specimens of which have often
  been mistaken for examples of the present species and recorded as such.
  The wings are rather more ample; the reniform and orbicular stigmata are
  reddish, with a blackish cloud under them, and the space between the
  second and submarginal lines towards the inner margin is also reddish.
  The hind wings are dark in both sexes. The caterpillar, which is said to
  feed in July and August on hop, honey-suckle, and cherry, among other
  plants, is pinkish brown, darker above; the dusky-pink central line on
  the back is interrupted and indistinct, and on each side of it is a
  series of oblique greyish but not clearly defined streaks; the line low
  down on the sides is yellow-green. The moths flies in June, July, and
  August.</p>

  <p>Abroad the species occurs in Central and Northern Europe (except the
  most northern parts, and perhaps Western France); eastward the range
  extends to Amurland.</p>

<h5><b>The Dark Brocade</b> (<i>Eumichtis</i> (<i>Hadena</i>) <i>adusta</i>).</h5>

  <p>The sexes of this moth are figured on Plate <a
  href="#plate121">121</a>, Figs. 3&#x2642;, 4&#x2640;. The ground colour
  is grey-brown in some examples of this species, whilst in others,
  especially in the north of England and in Scotland, the colour ranges
  through rich reddish brown, blackish brown to almost black. In the
  lighter coloured forms the markings are usually clear and distinct, but
  in the darker forms are often much obscured. The caterpillar is somewhat
  variable in colour and markings. Barrett describes one form as pale sage
  green strongly tinged with ochreous and dusted with greyish brown; the
  line along the middle of the back is white, interrupted, and edged with
  greyish brown; a series of outlines of greyish-brown diamonds spread over
  to the brown margin of the pale ochreous stripe along the whitish
  spiracles, and form a network on the back and sides. Another form,
  described by Buckler, has the general colour brilliant yellow, suffused
  on the upper surface with deep rose pink; a stripe on the middle of the
  back composed of two darker pink lines, united and forming a spot at the
  beginning of each segment, and an interrupted yellow stripe on each side.
  It feeds from July to September on grass and various low plants,
  including knot-grass, bladder campion (<i>Silene cucubalus</i>); also
  sweet gale, sallow, etc. The moth flies in June and July, sometimes in
  May. The species occurs in woods and on heaths and moors, and is
  generally distributed, and more or less common throughout the British
  Isles. The range abroad extends to Amurland.</p>

<h5><b>The Brindled Green</b> (<i>Eumichtis</i> (<i>Hadena</i>) <i>protea</i>).</h5>

  <p>Green of some shade is often the prevailing colour in the much
  ornamented moth portrayed on Plate <a href="#plate122">122</a>, Figs. 11,
  12; but in some specimens the general colour is pinkish white. The
  variegation consists of reddish brown or pinkish, and white clouds and
  black streaks, chiefly as edging to the pale cross lines, or between the
  stigmata; these latter are as often obscure as distinct, but sometimes
  the orbicular is white with a white mark below it extending to the black
  bar connecting the first and second cross lines.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is green freckled with yellow, with a yellow central
  line on the back; head brownish. It feeds from March to June, and when it
  leaves the egg it bores into an oak bud to <!-- Page 262 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="404.png"><a name="page262"></a>{262}</span>feed;
  later on it spins the young leaves together, and finally it dispenses
  with a retreat altogether and feeds openly on the leaves. The moth is out
  in the autumn, rather earlier in Scotland. It is widely distributed in
  England, and in some seasons and localities very abundant. In Scotland it
  is found from Roxburgh to Moray, and in the latter county as well as in
  Perthshire and Argyll it is often plentiful. Single specimens have been
  recorded from Ireland, and these from Co. Galway and Co. Westmeath.</p>

<h5><b>The Northern Arches</b> (<i>Crymodes exulis</i>).</h5>

  <p>The specimens of this species shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate123">123</a>, Figs. 1, 4, are from Shetland, and more or less
  of the typical form, but rather more variegated, perhaps, than the actual
  type. In other specimens from the same locality the yellowish submarginal
  line is band-like; or the ground colour is browner, and sometimes
  blackish. These blackish examples approach var. <i>assimilis</i>,
  Doubleday (Fig. 3), from Perthshire, where it was first met with, at
  Rannoch, by Weaver, over sixty years ago. <i>Exulis</i> (The Exile) was
  discovered by Mr. H. McArthur in the Shetlands in 1883. In 1896 Mr. P. M.
  Bright captured a specimen in the Shetlands which Barrett considered
  referable to <i>maillardi</i>, Hübn. (Geyer, Fig. 833.) "Its ground
  colour is drab-brown, abundantly marked with umberous and dusted with
  black, and its only conspicuous marking is the reniform stigma, which is
  distinctly edged with white in such a manner as to give it a singular
  resemblance to <i>Mamestra</i> [<i>Barathra</i>] <i>brassicæ</i>."
  Staudinger, it may be added, adopts <i>maillardi</i> as the earlier name
  for this species, and it may have to be generally accepted. The
  caterpillar is ochreous whitish, shaded with grey, and with yellowish
  plates on the first and last rings; spiracles black, head reddish brown.
  It feeds on grasses from August to May, but is sometimes two, or even
  three, years in completing its <!-- Page 263 --><span class="pagenum" title="405.png"
  ><a name="page263"></a>{263}</span>growth. When young, and also later, it
  eats the lower part of the stem and partly into the root of the grass.
  The moth is out in July and August. Very few examples of the
  <i>assimilis</i> form have been obtained, and these only in Perthshire,
  Aberdeenshire, Inverness, and the Isle of Arran. Mr. W. M. Christy
  captured one specimen in Ross-shire in August, 1902. The geographical
  range of this species extends from the Alps and Pyrenees through Norway
  and Lapland to Iceland, Greenland, and Labrador.</p>

<h5><b>The Minor Shoulder-Knot</b> (<i>Bombycia viminalis</i>).</h5>

  <p>Figs. 5 and 6 on Plate <a href="#plate125">125</a> represent the
  typical form of this species. Fig. 8 shows the blackish var.
  <i>obscura</i>, Staud., and Fig. 7 an intermediate form. The pale form is
  most frequent in southern England, and dark forms are commoner in the
  north. Both forms occur in Scotland, but in some parts the pale form only
  is found. The caterpillar is green with three whitish lines on the back;
  the raised spots are also whitish; the line along the black spiracles is
  yellowish. It feeds from April to June on sallow and willow; at first on
  the terminal shoots, the leaves of which are spun together with silk.
  Later on the caterpillar folds down or rolls a leaf so as to form a
  shelter. The moth is on the wing in June and July, sometimes later, and
  is pretty widely distributed throughout the British Isles, but is rather
  local in Scotland, northern England, and Ireland. The dark form, it may
  be mentioned, does not seem to be found abroad. The range of the species
  extends to Amurland.</p>

<h5><b>The Dusky Sallow</b> (<i>Eremobia ochroleuca</i>).</h5>

  <p>This brownish tinged ochreous moth (Plate <a href="#plate126">126</a>,
  Figs. 3, 4) has the fore wings crossed by whitish lines, the first and
  second of which approach or unite below the middle, dividing into two
  blotches the dark central band-like shade. <!-- Page 264 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="406.png"><a name="page264"></a>{264}</span></p>

  <p>The caterpillar, which feeds on the seeds of cock's-foot
  (<i>Dactylis</i>) and other kinds of grass from May to early July, is
  whitish green and glossy; three whitish stripes on the back, the central
  one broadest; a stripe below the black spiracles is whitish, edged above
  with green. Mullein (<i>Verbascum</i>) has also been mentioned as eaten
  by this caterpillar. The moth is out in July and in August, and may often
  be seen resting on the flowers of knapweed (<i>Centaurea</i>) in the
  daytime. It flies at night, and has been taken at the flowers of
  centaurea, ragwort, etc., and at light. In some districts it is said to
  visit the sugar patch, but not to do so in other localities. Occurs in
  the chalk districts of most southern English counties, and especially
  those of Kent and Sussex; also, but only rarely, in Warwickshire and
  Yorkshire. One specimen has been recorded from Pembrokeshire in
  Wales.</p>

<h5><b>The Orache Moth</b> (<i>Trachea atriplicis</i>).</h5>

  <p>In the past this greenish-mottled brownish moth (Plate <a
  href="#plate126">126</a>, Fig. 5) appears to have been commoner, and more
  widely distributed in England than it now is. Wilkes, in 1773, referring
  to it as "The Wild Arrach," states that it was taken occasionally near
  London. At the present time the species seems to occur only in the
  eastern counties, and chiefly in Cambridgeshire. In June, 1904 and 1905,
  specimens (three in all) were obtained at sugar in Huntingdonshire. The
  caterpillar is ochreous or reddish brown, dotted with white; three dark
  lines on the back, the central one only distinct. A yellowish stripe
  along the black-edged white spiracles; head light reddish brown, glossy.
  It feeds in July and August on orach (<i>Atriplex</i>), persicaria,
  knot-grass, and will also eat dock. The range abroad extends to Amurland,
  Corea, and Japan.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Note.</span>&mdash;It may be mentioned here that
  <i>Prodenia littoralis</i>, Boisd., an inhabitant of tropical and
  sub-tropical regions, has <!-- Page 265 --><span class="pagenum" title="407.png"
  ><a name="page265"></a>{265}</span>been occasionally reared in this
  country from caterpillars found in imported tomatoes.</p>

<h5><b>The Saxon</b> (<i>Lithom&oelig;a</i> (<i>Hyppa</i>) <i>rectilinea</i>).</h5>

  <p>The brownish clouding, and reddish-brown central band, of this species
  (Plate <a href="#plate126">126</a>, Figs. 6, 7) varies in tone; sometimes
  the band is olive grey and the clouding rather grey than brown. The
  caterpillar, according to Buckler, varies from dark brown to chestnut,
  ochreous, and orange browns; the spiracular stripe pale ochreous or cream
  colour, shading off in the middle to grey brown. It feeds from July to
  September, or later, on sallow, bramble, bearberry (<i>Arctostaphylos
  uva-ursi</i>), and will eat knot-grass. It hibernates when full grown,
  and pupates in the following spring. The moth is out in May, June, or
  July, and is taken at sugar, chiefly in woods. At one time it was found
  in Yorkshire, but Cumberland seems to be the only English county in which
  it now occurs. In Scotland it has been taken in the south. Renton states
  that near Hawick, Roxburghshire, he finds a few at raspberry blossom
  every year. It is more plentiful, however, from Perthshire to Sutherland.
  Kane notes it from Torc Wood, Killarney, near Galway, and Clonbrock; and
  that the form is identical with that from Aberdeen named
  <i>semivirgata</i>, Tutt. The range abroad extends to Siberia and
  Amurland; and the North American, <i>xylinoides</i>, Guen, seems to be a
  form of the present species.</p>

<h5><b>The Figure of Eight Moth</b> (<i>Diloba cæruleocephala</i>).</h5>

  <p>The greyish-centred white marks are the chief features on the brownish
  fore wings of this moth (Plate <a href="#plate127">127</a>, Figs. 1, 2).
  The first one, or both when quite apart, is very like the figure 8;
  sometimes these marks are united, and form an irregular blotch. Rarely
  the area between the black lines is dark and the marks <!-- Page 266
  --><span class="pagenum" title="408.png"><a
  name="page266"></a>{266}</span>obscured or absent. The caterpillar (Plate
  <a href="#plate133">133</a>, Fig. 1) is bluish grey, with a number of
  bristle-bearing black spots and minute black dots; a stripe along the
  back is yellow and interrupted; a yellow stripe low down along the sides.
  It feeds, from April to June, on hawthorn, sloe, and wild crab; also on
  the leaves of apple, plum, and other fruit trees. Sometimes these
  caterpillars are to be seen on the hedges in numbers, and usually seem to
  prefer the outer extremities of the longer shoots. The pale purplish
  brown chrysalis is enclosed in a strong somewhat oval cocoon, which is
  covered with fragments of litter, and often attached to some object, such
  as a bit of stick, leaves, etc., on the ground. The moth is out in
  October and November, but is rarely seen, except occasionally at gas
  lamps, etc. Generally common in the south and east of England, and widely
  distributed throughout the rest of the country to Cumberland. It has
  occurred in a few Clydesdale localities, and has been recorded by Renton
  as sometimes common in Roxburghshire. Widely distributed in Ireland, but
  not often plentiful.</p>

<h5><b>The Green Brindled Dot</b> (<i>Valeria oleagina</i>).</h5>

  <p>Nearly eighty years ago Stephens summed up all that was known of this
  species in Britain. As there is nothing to add in the way of later
  records, his remarks may be quoted. "Very rare; specimens have been found
  in Richmond Park, and one was taken in the pupa state by Mr. Plastead
  some twenty or thirty years ago in Battersea Fields; others have occurred
  near Bristol, and Mr. Donovan, I believe, captured one in South Wales; it
  has also been taken in Scotland. My specimens were from the former
  locality, and I have been fortunate enough to have had nearly a dozen
  examples at various periods." Most of the later authors mention only the
  Welsh specimen, taken at Fishguard in Pembrokeshire, July, 1800. A
  continental specimen is shown on Plate <a href="#plate127">127</a>, Fig.
  5. <!-- Page 267 --><span class="pagenum" title="409.png"><a

<h5><b>The Beautiful Gothic</b> (<i>Heliophobus hispidus</i>).</h5>

  <p>This species (Plate <a href="#plate127">127</a>, Figs. 6, 7) varies in
  the brown colour of the fore wings, which is sometimes of a greyish tint;
  not infrequently the pale cross lines are tinged with brownish, or they
  may be rather broad, and, the submarginal especially, white and very
  distinct; the reniform and orbicular marks are sometimes tinged with
  pink. The caterpillar (Plate <a href="#plate133">133</a>, Fig. 3) is pale
  rusty brown, with blackish markings, and three pale lines on the back;
  head glossy and rather paler than the body, and marked with two blackish
  lines. It feeds on grasses from September to March. The specimen figured
  (slightly enlarged) was received from Mr. Walker of Torquay on January
  11, 1907. The chrysalis (Fig. 3<span class="sm">A</span>) is dull
  reddish, ring divisions and wing-cases paler and brighter; two hooks on
  last ring. The moth is out from the latter part of August to early
  October, and in its haunts, which are cliffs by the sea, it may be found
  at night sitting on grass stems. It is not known to visit flowers or the
  sugar patch, but has been taken at light. Although previously taken in
  the Isle of Portland, the earliest published record was that in the
  <i>Zoologist</i> for 1849 of a specimen taken on the sandhills at
  Exmouth, late in September. It still occurs at Portland and at Swanage in
  Dorset; also in the Isle of Wight and along the Devon coast to Cornwall.
  The range abroad is restricted, the species only being noted from
  Southern France, North-east and Southern Spain, Sicily, Palestine, and
  North-west Africa.</p>

<h5><b>The Flounced Rustic</b> (<i>Luperina testacea</i>).</h5>

  <p>Portraits of this moth will be found on Plate <a
  href="#plate128">128</a>, Figs. 5, 6. The ground colour of the fore wings
  ranges from very pale brown through greyish brown to blackish. In some
  specimens the markings are very faint, and, excepting the whitish
  submarginal line, are hardly visible. Usually there is a black or <!--
  Page 268 --><span class="pagenum" title="410.png"><a
  name="page268"></a>{268}</span>dark brown bar connecting the first and
  second cross lines; not infrequently there is a black mark on the inner
  margin below the bar, and a black mark or two in the cell above. These
  marks are sometimes supplemented by others, and so form a more or less
  complete black central band. The reniform and orbicular stigmata are
  often only outlined in paler brown, but they may be whitish and very
  distinct. Var. <i>guenéei</i>, Doubleday, is pale ochreous brown, with
  the first line pale, interrupted, and terminating in a black dot on inner
  margin; and the second line made up of white-edged black crescents; the
  reniform distinctly edged with white, and there is a slender black line
  above the inner margin between the first line and the base of the wing.
  Hind wings pure white, with black marginal lunules.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is pinkish ochreous; usual dots not in evidence; skin
  much wrinkled and glossy; spiracles pink margined with black; head and
  plate on first ring pale brownish yellow. Robson (Cat. Lep. of Durham,
  etc.) states that the caterpillar feeds on grass roots, and adds, "I have
  known it abound in the grass tufts at the foot of palings around a large
  mill." The moth is out in August and September. At night it flies freely
  to light, but is not known to visit any of the usual floral attractions
  or the collector's sugar. Generally distributed and often common.</p>

<h5><b>Dumeril's Luperina</b> (<i>Luperina dumerilii</i>).</h5>

  <p>Fore wings ochreous grey or brown, two brownish streaks represent the
  basal line; the space between the first and second cross lines darker,
  and there is a darker band on the outer margin; the stigmata are pale
  inclining to yellowish, and the veins below them are white. Hind wings
  whitish tinged with darker on outer margin. Ab. <i>desyllesi</i>, Boisd.,
  has almost unicolorous fore wings, and this form, according to
  Staudinger, has been found in Northern France and England. I have only
  seen a continental specimen of this species, which is very local and
  somewhat rare abroad.</p>

  <p>In his <i>Manual</i>, vol. i. (1857), Stainton states, "one specimen
  has occurred in the Isle of Arran." Reference is made in 1885
  (<i>Entom.</i> xviii. 73) to two specimens taken in the Isle of Portland
  in 1858, and three others in 1859. Then, in the <i>Entomologist</i> for
  1902, Mr. Stockwell records, from Dover, the capture of "a fine female of
  this rare Noctua, on a gas lamp in this town, during the latter part of
  September."</p>

<h5><b>The Straw Underwing</b> (<i>Cerigo matura</i>).</h5>

  <p>This moth, both sexes of which are shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate128">128</a>, Figs. 2, 3, is readily recognized by the
  yellowish hind wings. The caterpillar is ochreous or dull reddish brown;
  series of greyish brown marks along the middle of the back, and a brown
  edged line on each side; a pale ochreous line edged above with brown low
  down along the sides; head pale brown, with darker streaks. It feeds from
  September to April, sometimes later, on grasses, chiefly in dry
  situations. The moth is out in July and August. Generally distributed
  throughout the British Isles, but in Scotland not recorded north of
  Moray. In suitable localities it is common, and sometimes is the only
  visitor to the sugar patch.</p>

<h5><b>Haworth's Minor</b> (<i>Celæna haworthii</i>).</h5>

  <p>In this reddish brown moth (Plate <a href="#plate128">128</a>, Fig. 7)
  the reniform and orbicular stigmata are white or broadly outlined in
  white, and the vein below as well as the branches also white. The wings
  of the female are smaller than those of the male, and the body is
  distinctly stouter. The white markings referred to are sometimes obscured
  or absent, and such specimens are referable <!-- Page 270 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="414.png"><a name="page270"></a>{270}</span>to var.
  <i>hibernica</i>, Haworth. The caterpillar is purplish brown, with the
  usual raised dots darker brown; three pale lines along the back, the
  central one least distinct; head and plates on first and last rings
  reddish brown; spiracles black. From April to July on cotton grass
  (<i>Eriophorum vaginatum</i>), feeding in the stems down towards the
  root. The moth flies in August and September. It was first noted as
  British in 1819, and Stephens in 1829 mentions it as common in Whittlesea
  Mere. Although still occurring in the fens, the species is far more
  common on the moors and mosses of Northern England, Scotland to the
  Shetlands, and in Ireland.</p>

<h5><b>The Crescent Striped</b> (<i>Hama oblonga</i> (<i>abjecta</i>)).</h5>

  <p>In its most frequent form this species (Plate <a
  href="#plate131">131</a>, Figs. 5, 6) has the fore wings greyish brown
  and somewhat shining; the markings, especially the cross lines,
  indistinctly paler; the reniform is outwardly dotted with white.
  Sometimes the ground colour is paler grey with black markings arranged
  very similar to such marks in <i>A. gemina</i>, var. <i>remissa</i> (Fig.
  8).</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is greenish grey, with the raised dots rather greyer;
  a pinkish line along the back; head and plate on first and last rings
  shining reddish brown. It feeds on grasses growing in salt marshes, edges
  of tidal rivers, and ditches of brackish water: in the spring and until
  June; perhaps from September. The moth is out from June to August, and
  may be obtained at the flowers of marram grass as well as at sugar. The
  species is found in most of the eastern and southern seaboard counties of
  England; at Sandown and Freshwater in the Isle of Wight; in the fens of
  Huntingdon and Cambridge; also occasionally in Herefordshire,
  Gloucestershire, Lancs, Yorks, and Durham. In Scotland it has been
  obtained in Moray and in the Shetlands. Local in Ireland. The range
  abroad extends to Amurland. <!-- Page 271 --><span class="pagenum" title="415.png"
  ><a name="page271"></a>{271}</span></p>

<h5><b>The Large Nutmeg</b> (<i>Hama sordida</i>).</h5>

  <p>The fore wings of this moth (Plate <a href="#plate131">131</a>, Figs.
  1, 2) are pale ochreous brown, much marbled with darker brown, and
  sometimes slightly tinged with reddish; the pale stigmata and submarginal
  line are the most distinct of the usual markings. The caterpillar is said
  to be very like that of <i>Apamea basilinea</i>. The moth flies in June,
  and is not uncommon in most parts of Southern England. It occurs in
  Lancashire and Cheshire, but is more frequent in Yorkshire and Durham;
  also found in South Wales, and although it has been obtained in the
  Shetlands, it seems to be very local and infrequent in Scotland. Only
  twice recorded from Ireland, one specimen on the Dublin coast, 1860, and
  one at Howth (Kane).</p>

<h5><b>The Confused</b> (<i>Hama furva</i>).</h5>

  <p>This darker mottled greyish brown moth (Plate <a
  href="#plate131">131</a>, Figs. 3, 4) is very similar to the typical form
  of <i>A. gemina</i> (Fig. 7); the fore wings, however, are distinctly
  broader at the base, the W-like angles of the submarginal line are less
  noticeable, and this line is comparatively straighter. The reddish tinge
  so usual in <i>A. gemina</i> is absent in the present species.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is ochreous tinged with pinkish, except on the first
  three rings and the under surface; central line dusky; usual dots reddish
  brown, as also are the head and plates on first and last rings. On
  grasses, September to June, feeding chiefly on the shoots near the roots
  (condensed from Buckler). The moth occurs from July to September, and may
  be obtained at flowers of ragwort, scabious, etc., and freely at sugar,
  in rocky places from Lancashire northwards through Scotland to the
  Shetlands. It also occurs in Wales, and suitable places in Gloucester,
  Somerset, Devon, Cornwall, and has also been recorded from Sussex. In
  Ireland found on several parts of <!-- Page 272 --><span class="pagenum" title="416.png"
  ><a name="page272"></a>{272}</span>the coast, but not plentiful. Abroad
  the range extends to Amurland.</p>

<h5><b>The Dusky Brocade</b> (<i>Apamea obscura</i> (<i>gemina</i>)).</h5>

  <p>In its ordinary form the moth shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate131">131</a> is purplish brown, as in Fig. 7, sometimes
  mottled with greyish or pale ochreous. A more ornamented form is known as
  var. <i>remissa</i> (Fig. 8), and the ground colour of this is not
  infrequently pale ochreous brown, or almost whitish, with the black
  marking very conspicuous. The caterpillar is brownish grey, finely
  striated with darker; a yellowish white line along the middle of the
  back, and a brownish ochreous stripe on each side of it; stripe along the
  black edged spiracles greyish ochreous. It feeds from autumn till March
  on grasses in moist situations. The moth is perhaps most abundant in the
  south, but it occurs, in June and July, pretty well all over the British
  Isles; and abroad its range extends to Amurland and Japan.</p>

<h5><b>The Rustic Shoulder Knot</b> (<i>Apamea basilinea</i>).</h5>

  <p>The species shown on Plate <a href="#plate132">132</a>, Figs.
  1&#x2642;, 2&#x2640;, is found almost everywhere in the British Isles, is
  generally common, and in many parts abundant. Usually the pale brown fore
  wings are clouded or suffused with reddish, but this tint may be absent,
  or the wings may be tinged with greyish: the single black dash from
  middle of the base is the "Shoulder Knot." The caterpillar, according to
  Barrett, is pale olive brown varying to grey brown; a greyish white line
  along the middle of the back edged with short undulating black lines;
  spiracular line a row of blackish dashes, clouded with olive brown, or
  edged with greyish white and looped with grey brown; head black, plate on
  first ring black and white striped. It feeds from August to March on
  grasses, etc. The moth flies in May and June. <!-- Page 273 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="417.png"><a name="page273"></a>{273}</span></p>

<h5><b>The Small Clouded Brindle</b> (<i>Apamea unanimis</i>).</h5>

  <p>The fore wings are generally reddish brown mottled with darker, but
  the reddish tinge may be almost absent; the reniform is more or less
  outlined in white and there are two black streaks from the base. (Plate
  <a href="#plate132">132</a>, Figs. 3&#x2642;, 4&#x2640;.) The caterpillar
  is pale ochreous brown, sometimes tinged with greenish; three dark edged
  pale lines on the back; spiracular line pale edged above with darker;
  head, and plate on first ring, brown and glossy. On grasses that occur in
  damp places, such as water meads, marshes and fens from July to April.
  The moth flies in June and July. It is widely distributed, and sometimes
  common in most moist localities throughout England. More local in
  Scotland but occurring in Aberdeenshire, and on the western side ranging
  to the Orkneys. Not frequent in Ireland, but has been obtained in several
  parts. The distribution abroad extends to Amurland.</p>

<h5><b>The Union Rustic</b> (<i>Apamea pabulatricula</i>).</h5>

  <p>The very distinctly marked, and sometimes brownish tinged, greyish
  white moth shown on Plate <a href="#plate132">132</a>, Fig. 12, is very
  local in the British Isles, and apart from its reported occurrence in the
  Clyde and Tay districts of Scotland, seems to be found only in some of
  the woods of South Yorkshire, as near Rotherham, Sheffield (Wharncliffe
  Woods), and Barnsley. It has been obtained in Cumberland; and Barrett
  states that formerly it occurred in Norfolk. The caterpillar, which is
  little known, is said to feed on grasses in May. The moth flies in August
  and early September. It is also known as <i>connexa</i>, Bork. <!-- Page
  274 --><span class="pagenum" title="418.png"><a
  name="page274"></a>{274}</span></p>

<h5><b>The Common Rustic</b> (<i>Apamea secalis</i>).</h5>

  <p>Following Guenée, British entomologists at one time knew this species
  as <i>oculea</i>; afterwards it became the habit to label it
  <i>didyma</i>, a name given to it by Esper in 1788. Just now the
  authorities insist on <i>secalis</i>, Linnæus, being adopted. The species
  is an exceedingly variable one, and six examples of it are shown on Plate
  <a href="#plate132">132</a>, Figs. 6 to 11. The form with blackish fore
  wings and a white reniform mark is var. <i>leucostigma</i>, Esp.
  <i>Nictitans</i>, Esp., has brownish fore wings and a white reniform.
  <i>I-niger</i>, Haw., is greyish or grey brown with darker central band,
  and the cross lines united by a black bar. Ochreous or reddish ochreous
  specimens with the front marginal area broadly and irregularly reddish
  brown, and the outer margin bordered with reddish brown, are referable to
  var. <i>furca</i>, Haw. Many other forms have been named. The caterpillar
  is green with three reddish lines on the back; head and plate on the
  first ring pale brown, also plate on last ring. In stems of grasses such
  as <i>Festuca</i>, <i>Dactylis</i>, etc., also on wood-rush. From Autumn
  to April or May. The moth flies in July and August, and is common
  everywhere in the British Isles; its range abroad extends to Western
  China.</p>

<h5><b>The Double Lobed</b> (<i>Apamea ophiogramma</i>).</h5>

  <p>This species (Plate <a href="#plate132">132</a>, Fig. 5) is usually
  found in marshy localities, or in gardens, over the eastern counties, and
  from Northamptonshire through Bucks, and Hertfordshire, to Kent, and
  Surrey. The caterpillar feeds from September on the shoots of <i>Phalaris
  arundinacea</i> and the cultivated form of that plant grown in gardens,
  and known as ribbon grass. Also said to feed on <i>Poa aquatica</i>. When
  the grass dies down in the late autumn the caterpillar enters the ground
  to hibernate, and <!-- Page 275 --><span class="pagenum" title="419.png"
  ><a name="page275"></a>{275}</span>emerges in the spring ready to attack
  the young grass shoots as soon as they appear. Where the new growth of
  ribbon grass assumes a brown and withered appearance this larva will
  probably be found at the bottom of the trouble. When nearly full grown it
  eats down the interior of the thicker stems to the base. In colour it is
  ochreous with a pinkish tinge; a pale brownish plate on first and last
  rings, each edged with blackish and that on the first ring traversed by a
  white line; head pale brown, glossy. The moth flies in July and August,
  sometimes in June.</p>

<h5><b>The Marbled Minor</b> (<i>Miana strigilis</i>).</h5>

  <p>Half a dozen specimens are shown on Plate <a href="#plate134">134</a>,
  and these will serve to give some idea of the range of aberration in this
  species. The most typical of the species are those represented by Figs. 1
  and 4; the farthest removed from the type is var. <i>æthiops</i>, Haworth
  (Fig. 16). In the reddish var. <i>latruncula</i>, Hübn., as figured by
  him, the most conspicuous character is the white lower curve of the
  second cross line, as in Fig. 7.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is purplish brown above, and ochreous below; striped
  on the back with pale yellow, and less distinctly on the sides; spiracles
  black and very distinct; head and plates on the first and last rings of
  the body ochreous brown and shining. Found in March and April, after
  hibernation, feeding on the stems of various grasses. The moth is out in
  June and July, and may frequently be seen at rest on palings, etc., but
  at night it often abounds at sugar or honey dew. Generally distributed in
  the British Isles, except perhaps in the islands of Scotland.</p>

<h5><b>The Middle-barred Minor</b> (<i>Miana fasciuncula</i>).</h5>

  <p>In its typical form this species (Plate <a href="#plate134">134</a>,
  Fig. 3) has the fore wings reddish ochreous, with a darker central band,
  and <!-- Page 276 --><span class="pagenum" title="420.png"><a
  name="page276"></a>{276}</span>the cross lines, especially the second,
  distinctly white towards the inner margin. Sometimes, chiefly in
  Scotland, the ground colour is much paler, occasionally almost whitish,
  and the band reddish (var. <i>cana</i>, Staud., Figs. 5, 8). There is a
  good deal of variation, both in the ground colour and in that of the
  band; the latter is often smoky brown in pale specimens of both
  sexes.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is of a pale flesh tint, rather inclining to greyish
  ochreous, the dorsal stripe of a darker tint of the same colour well
  defined on each side by the pale ground colour; next a very broad stripe
  of pinkish brown, followed by a narrow stripe of the ground colour,
  faintly edged below with pinkish brown; above the black spiracles is a
  stripe of pinkish brown freckles; head and plates on first and last rings
  of the body light brown, shining (Buckler). In the shoots of grasses such
  as <i>Aira cespitosa</i>, in April and early May, probably after
  hibernation. The moth is out in May and June, and its haunts are moist
  woods and marshy grounds, generally. The species is widely distributed,
  and often common, throughout the British Isles. Abroad it seems to have a
  very limited range.</p>

<h5><b>The Rosy Minor</b> (<i>Miana literosa</i>).</h5>

  <p>The ground colour is pale, or dark, violet grey, more or less clouded
  inwards from the submarginal line, and on the basal area, with purplish;
  a central reddish or reddish brown band is limited inwardly by the,
  sometimes, whitish edged black first line, and outwardly by an almost
  straight black line passing between the stigmata to the inner margin.
  (Plate <a href="#plate134">134</a>, Figs. 11, 14.)</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is dingy ochreous yellow, with a dark purplish stripe,
  enclosing a central line of the ground colour, on the back; spiracles
  black; head dark brown, plates pale brown (Porritt). From September to
  June, in stems of <i>Carex glauca</i>, <i>Dactylis glomerata</i>, and
  other grasses. The moth flies in July and August, and although rare
  inland is pretty generally distributed around the coasts of the British
  Isles; apparently, from the Clyde area, confined to the east coast of
  Scotland, and not extending north of Moray.</p>

<h5><b>The Cloaked Minor</b> (<i>Miana bicoloria</i>).</h5>

  <p>This is another variable species of the genus, and five specimens of
  it are shown on Plate <a href="#plate134">134</a>. The typical form (Fig.
  3) has the fore wings more or less brownish on the basal area, and
  whitish bordered with brownish on the outer area. Very frequently these
  wings are pale, or dark, brown marbled with darker brown, and with the
  stigmata and cross lines distinct, faint, or absent. Fig. 15 represents a
  form from Ireland, which is uniformly pale ochreous brown, sometimes
  reddish tinged. The caterpillar is yellowish ochreous, tinged with pink;
  three dull reddish interrupted bands, each intersected by a line of the
  ground colour; head reddish brown; plates on first and last rings of the
  body pale reddish brown (Buckler). In stems of grasses, such as
  <i>Festuca</i> and <i>Aira</i>&mdash;April and May; probably after
  hibernation. The moth flies in August and September, sometimes earlier.
  At dusk it is often common in rough fields and grassy places near the
  sea. Although found in some inland localities, it is more especially a
  coast species, and as such is widely distributed over the British Isles
  to the Orkneys.</p>

<h5><b>The Least Minor</b> (<i>Phothedes captiuncula</i>).</h5>

  <p>The pretty little moth shown on Plate <a href="#plate134">134</a>,
  Figs. 17, 18, has the fore wings brownish ochreous, tinged with reddish
  brown, and with a darker central band and hind margin. Sometimes the
  whole basal area up to the white second line <!-- Page 278 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="424.png"><a name="page278"></a>{278}</span>is
  reddish brown; and in a form from Ireland named <i>tincta</i>, Kane, the
  coloration is somewhat similar to that of <i>M. literosa</i>. This
  species was first discovered in Britain by Messrs. Law and Sang, in a
  locality near Darlington, Durham, in 1854. It is now obtained in several
  places in that county, and in Northumberland. Also found in North
  Lancashire, Westmoreland, and once in Yorkshire. It occurs commonly in
  Co. Galway and Clare, Ireland, and has once been taken in Killarney.
  There is also a record from Perthshire in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is dull ochreous, with a reddish tinge inclining to
  purplish on rings two to seven; head reddish brown; plates on first and
  last rings yellow brown, the former edged in front with darker brown;
  spiracles black, three yellow spots on sides of rings two and three
  (Buckler). On <i>Carex glauca</i> and other sedges, eating down the stems
  close to the roots. Will also eat ribbon grass&mdash;August to June. The
  moth flies, often in the early afternoon, from late June to August. It
  seems partial to rough fields, and hillsides, chiefly on the coast.</p>

<h5><b>The Clouded-bordered Brindle</b> (<i>Xylophasia rurea</i>).</h5>

  <p>Of this common, generally distributed, and often abundant species,
  portraits of the typical form (Fig. 1), and of var. <i>alopecurus</i>,
  Esp. (Fig. 2), will be found on Plate <a href="#plate135">135</a>. The
  ground colour varies from the normal greyish white to a silvery white
  (var. <i>argentea</i>, Tutt), and through yellowish shades to a reddish
  ochreous; the markings in all these colour aberrations are more or less
  typical. In the var. <i>alopecurus</i>, Esp., there are also gradations;
  thus <i>combusta</i>, Haworth, is dark greyish brown; and a blackish
  brown, red tinged form is <i>nigro-rubidea</i>, Tutt. The caterpillar
  (Plate <a href="#plate130">130</a>, Fig. 4) is variable in colour, one
  form is ochreous grey with three lines on the back, the central one white
  shaded on each side with grey; usual dots and spiracles are black; head
  blackish and shining. From <!-- Page 279 --><span class="pagenum" title="425.png"
  ><a name="page279"></a>{279}</span>August to May on grasses. The range
  abroad extends to Amurland.</p>

<h5><b>The Light Arches</b> (<i>Xylophasia lithoxylea</i>).</h5>

  <p>In this whitish ochreous species (Plate <a href="#plate135">135</a>,
  Fig. 3) there is little variation except that the darker clouding is more
  pronounced in some specimens than in others. The caterpillar is brownish
  grey, tinged with ochreous or with greenish; usual dots blackish, as also
  are the head and the plates on first and last rings of the body. October
  to May, feeding on stems of grasses, near the roots. The moth is out in
  June and July, and is often seen on fences, etc., in the daytime.
  Generally distributed, and common in most places throughout the British
  Isles. In Scotland, however, it does not range north of Moray, and only
  on the eastern side.</p>

<h5><b>The Reddish Light Arches</b> (<i>Xylophasia sublustris</i>).</h5>

  <p>Except that the fore wings are somewhat reddish tinged, and not so
  long, this species (Plate <a href="#plate135">135</a>, Fig. 6) is very
  similar to the last. The caterpillar is also very like that of the Light
  Arches, but has more red in its coloration. The moth is out in June and
  July, and affects limestone and chalk localities, and these chiefly on
  the coast. In Berkshire and adjoining counties it occurs in beech woods.
  Specimens have been recorded from Kendal in Westmoreland, but Yorkshire
  has been considered the northern limit of the species in England. It has
  been recorded occasionally from the fens. Paisley and Bonhill are given
  as Scottish localities in the <i>Fauna of the Clyde Area</i> (1901).
  Widely distributed in Ireland but most abundant in the province of
  Connaught.</p>

  <p><i>Xylophasia zollikoferi.</i> The home of this species would seem to
  be in parts of Hungary, Russia and Western Asia, whence it very
  occasionally finds its way across the continent <!-- Page 280 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="426.png"><a name="page280"></a>{280}</span>to
  England. Its British history is as follows:&mdash;a specimen taken at
  Deal, by Mr. Harding, October, 1867; one at Inverurie in Scotland, by Mr.
  Tait, September, 1871; and one at sugar by Mr. T. A. Lofthouse at
  Linthorpe, Middlesbrough, September 26, 1903. Also recorded from Norwich,
  September, 1905, and from Methley, Yorks, August, 1910. (Plate <a
  href="#plate153">153</a>, Fig. 6.)</p>

<h5><b>The Dark Arches</b> (<i>Xylophasia monoglypha</i>).</h5>

  <p>The five portraits of this moth on Plate <a href="#plate136">136</a>
  will give some idea of the various forms it assumes. The blackish
  specimen is referable to var. <i>infuscata</i>, White, and an extreme
  aberration of this form has been named <i>æthiops</i>, Tutt. The
  caterpillar is greyish, inclining to brownish or reddish; usual dots
  blackish; head and plate on first ring of body dark brownish, and
  shining. August to September, feeding on grasses and devouring the stems
  near the base. The moth is out from June to August, sometimes in October
  and November. It occurs in all parts of the British Isles and is often
  abundant.</p>

<h5><b>The Clouded Brindle</b> (<i>Xylophasia hepatica</i>).</h5>

  <p>The most frequent form of this species (Plate <a
  href="#plate135">135</a>) has the fore wings pale brown, with
  well-defined black markings, but without distinct cross lines. When the
  wings are more clouded and suffused with reddish or purplish brown the
  paler ground colour shows up as cross lines, and these are more or less
  edged with blackish (var. <i>characterea</i>, Hübner). The caterpillar
  (Plate <a href="#plate130">130</a>, Fig. 2) is dingy brown with shining
  black dots; three pale ochreous lines along the back, the central one
  most distinct; head black and shining; plate on first ring of the body
  black crossed by white lines, another on the last ring is blackish. Feeds
  from August to April on grasses, but will also eat various low plants.
  The chrysalis (Fig. 2<span class="sm">A</span>) which <!-- Page 281
  --><span class="pagenum" title="427.png"><a
  name="page281"></a>{281}</span>is enclosed in a tender earthen cocoon, is
  reddish, blackish between the rings, and the last ring, which is blunt at
  apex, is furnished with four hooks. The moth is out in June and July. A
  common species in the eastern and southern counties of England, but less
  frequent or rare in the Midlands and northwards to Roxburgh in Scotland.
  Local and not numerous in Ireland. Range abroad extends to Amurland.</p>

<h5><b>The Slender Brindle</b> (<i>Xylophasia scolopacina</i>).</h5>

  <p>This is another species with reddish brown clouded, pale ochreous
  brown fore wings. The ground colour may be whiter or redder than in the
  specimens shown on Plate <a href="#plate135">135</a>, Figs. 7, 8. The
  caterpillar (Plate <a href="#plate130">130</a>, Fig. 1) is dusky green
  above and whitish green beneath, the green shading into blackish along
  the sides; a fine whitish line along the middle of the back; usual dots
  black; head honey-brown and glossy, the jaws and a spot on each cheek
  black. It feeds on the juicy lower part of the stems of grasses, such as
  <i>Triticum</i>, but will also eat the leaves. In the spring, and till
  June, probably after hibernation. The moth is out in July and August, and
  as an uncommon event may be seen at rest on a tree trunk or paling.
  Stephens (1829) refers to its occurrence in the London district, and it
  still appears in woods around Highgate. It seems to be most plentiful in
  the woods of South Yorkshire, and in the Sherwood district of
  Nottinghamshire; but it has been found more or less frequently in several
  of the southern counties of England, and also in some northern ones. Its
  range abroad extends to Amurland and Japan.</p>

<h5><b>The Bird's Wing</b> (<i>Dipterygia scabriuscula</i>).</h5>

  <p>The curious wing-like marks on the blackish fore wings of this moth
  (Plate <a href="#plate137">137</a>, Figs. 1&#x2642;, 2&#x2640;) are its
  chief features. The <!-- Page 282 --><span class="pagenum" title="428.png"
  ><a name="page282"></a>{282}</span>stigmata are outlined in black, but
  are rarely paler than the ground colour. The caterpillar is reddish brown
  with yellow and black dots; three lines along the back, the central one
  white with a black edging, and the others blackish; head brown and
  glossy, marked with black; a blackish plate on first ring is also glossy,
  and is followed by a black mark on the next ring, both streaked with
  white. It feeds on dock, sorrel, and plants of the genus
  <i>Polygonum</i>, in July and August. The moth flies in late May and
  June, sometimes as a second generation in August or September. It occurs
  more or less commonly in most southern and eastern counties from
  Oxfordshire. In other parts of England, and in Scotland, it seems to be
  local or absent.</p>

<h5><b>The Purple Cloud</b> (<i>Cloantha polyodon</i>).</h5>

  <p>This moth is figured on Plate <a href="#plate137">137</a>, Fig. 7. The
  first recorded British specimen was taken at Yarmouth, in June, 1839. In
  1855 a specimen, found in a spider's web at Ashford, Hampshire, was
  exhibited at a meeting, held in May, of the Entomological Society of
  London. Two specimens were taken in 1892; one at Folkestone, Kent, at
  sugar, and the other outside Norwich, in Norfolk, at a gas lamp. In the
  <i>Entomologist</i> for 1894, there is a record of a specimen captured at
  sugar, July, 1891, at Clonbrock, Co. Galway, Ireland. The species has a
  wide range abroad, extending eastward to Amurland and Japan.</p>

<h5><b>The Deep-brown Dart</b> (<i>Aporophyla lutulenta</i>).</h5>

  <p>In the south of England the species (Plate <a
  href="#plate137">137</a>, Figs. 9, 10) is generally of a dark brown
  coloration on the fore wings, and the markings are often indistinct; but
  blackish forms also occur, although the latter are more frequent
  northwards, and in Scotland and Ireland are the prevailing form of the
  species. In black or blackish specimens, usually referred to
  <i>luneburgensis</i>, <!-- Page 283 --><span class="pagenum" title="429.png"
  ><a name="page283"></a>{283}</span>Freyer, the hind wings in the male,
  have the veins more or less blackish and dotted with black beyond the
  middle; var. <i>sedi</i>, Guenée, has the fore wings pale greyish with
  the markings distinct, and the central area blackish.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is green, sometimes tinged with pink on the first
  three rings; three brownish broken lines along the back, and a violet
  edged white line along the spiracles. It feeds on grasses, yarrow,
  groundsel, dock, plantain, gromwell (<i>Lithospermum</i>), and other low
  herbage; also on buds of hawthorn and sloe in the spring. October to
  April. The moth is out in August and September, sometimes later. It is
  found most frequently on the coast, perhaps, but occurs in
  Cambridgeshire, Hunts, Oxfordshire, Gloucestershire, Berks, Kent, Surrey,
  Sussex, Hants, and Isle of Wight; from Somerset to Cornwall; North and
  South Wales, Cheshire, Lancashire, and Yorkshire, and apparently in all
  counties northward except Westmoreland. Widely distributed in Scotland
  from the border to the Hebrides and Orkneys. It is found only on the
  coast in Ireland, and chiefly in the north-west.</p>

<h5><b>The Black Rustic</b> (<i>Aporophyla nigra</i>).</h5>

  <p>This black or brownish black moth (Plate <a href="#plate137">137</a>,
  Fig. 8) has the outer edge of the reniform stigma ochreous, and the cross
  lines are sometimes dotted with the same colour. The caterpillar is
  green, yellowish-brown, or dull purplish; first three rings often tinged
  with reddish; three darker, often broken, lines along the back; line
  along the black-edged white spiracles yellowish. It feeds on bedstraw
  (<i>Galium mollugo</i>), dock, plantain, grasses, etc. October to May.
  (The egg is figured on Plate <a href="#plate139">139</a>, Fig. 3.) The
  moth is out in September and October. Chiefly a northern species, but it
  occurs in some of the southern counties. It is, however, most frequent in
  Northampton, Huntingdon, and Cambridgeshire; in Gloucestershire, <!--
  Page 284 --><span class="pagenum" title="430.png"><a
  name="page284"></a>{284}</span>and Wales, and in the Isle of Man,
  Cumberland, and Westmoreland. In Lincolnshire, Yorkshire, and Lancashire
  it seems to be local or rare. It is found up to Moray in Scotland, and is
  sometimes plentiful in Aberdeenshire, Inverness, and Moray. Very local in
  Ireland, but Kane says that it is found in the extreme north, south,
  east, and west.</p>

<h5><b>The Feathered Brindle</b> (<i>Aporophyla australis</i>).</h5>

  <p>The fore wings are pale grey, sometimes darker clouded, chiefly on the
  costa; the black cross lines, slender, wavy, but not always distinct; a
  short black bar from middle of the base and one below it on the inner
  margin; often two other bars, pretty much in a line with the basal ones,
  on the central area; a row of black wedges on the outer area, near
  margin. Hind wings white in the male, pale brownish grey in the female.
  Most of our specimens, perhaps all, are referable to var. <i>pascuea</i>,
  Curtis. The caterpillar is yellowish green tinged with reddish above; a
  pale reddish line along the middle of the back has black V-shaped marks
  upon it, and there is a series of black marks on each side; the line
  along the spiracles yellowish; head green, brown freckled. Feeds, from
  October to April, on grasses, catchfly (<i>Silene maritima</i>), etc. The
  moth, which is figured on Plate <a href="#plate137">137</a>, Figs. 3, 4,
  is out from late August to October.</p>

  <p>This is a local species in England and occurs on the south coast; in
  Kent, on the sand hills at Deal; in Sussex, on the downs at Brighton and
  Lewes; also on downs on the Isle of Wight. Farther west it is found at
  Portland in Dorset, and Torquay in Devon; thence along the Devon and
  Cornish coasts. In Ireland it is obtained, according to Kane, on the
  coast of Wicklow and Waterford, and is not scarce on the sand hills of
  Wexford Harbour.</p>

<h5><b>The Feathered Ranunculus</b> (<i>Epunda lichenea</i>).</h5>

  <p>This is a maritime species and is chiefly found in the Isle of Wight,
  the Isle of Portland, and along the coasts of Cornwall, Devon, Somerset,
  Gloucester, and on the opposite Welsh coast. It is locally common in
  Cheshire and Lancashire, and occurs on the coast of North Wales, in Flint
  and Carnarvon. In Yorkshire it is not uncommon at Scarborough. Has been
  recorded from the Lincolnshire coast and from Eastbourne. There are two
  records from Scotland&mdash;Renfrew and Ayr. In Ireland it is common at
  Howth, and abundant at Rossbeigh, Co. Kerry. This species, and the last
  two, have a rather limited range abroad. On Plate <a
  href="#plate137">137</a> are portraits of two local forms, Fig. 5 is from
  Portland, and Fig. 6 from Plymouth. It will be noted that the former is
  greyish in tone whilst the latter is greenish and rather larger. Similar
  local variation occurs throughout the range of the species.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar (Plate <a href="#plate133">133</a>, Fig. 2) is olive
  green inclining to brownish above; along the back are darker markings
  forming a central stripe and a paler interrupted stripe on each side; a
  pale stripe along the spiracles. It feeds from autumn to May on various
  low plants. The moth flies from late August to early October. The first
  British specimen is said to have been taken in the New Forest in 1847;
  but in 1850 about a hundred were captured at New Brighton in
  Cheshire.</p>

<h5><b>The Brindled Ochre</b> (<i>Dasypolia templi</i>).</h5>

  <p>The dull ochreous-brown moth shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate138">138</a>, Fig. 1, has hardly any well-defined markings,
  but the cross lines are generally darker, and the reniform and orbicular
  paler. The caterpillar, which feeds in the stems of cow-parsnip
  (<i>Heracleum sphondylium</i>) from April to August, is pinkish ochreous
  with a rather darker stripe on the back; raised spots brown; head <!--
  Page 286 --><span class="pagenum" title="434.png"><a
  name="page286"></a>{286}</span>reddish brown. The moth flies in the
  autumn, and, after hibernation, in the spring. It frequents rocky places
  on the coast and on hills. Its range in England is pretty much as in the
  last species, but it does not seem to occur on the south-east coast. In
  Scotland it is widely spread over the country to the Orkneys, and has
  been found in the most northern isle of the Shetlands, but it is
  generally uncommon. It has been taken near Dublin in Ireland, and less
  frequently in Antrim and Donegal.</p>

<h5><b>The Large Ranunculus</b> (<i>Polia flavicincta</i>).</h5>

  <p>The fore wings of this moth (Plate <a href="#plate138">138</a>, Figs.
  6 and 7), are pale grey, clouded, and marked with darker; yellowish
  freckles at the base, and on the central area and the submarginal line
  are usually, but not always, present. Sometimes, chiefly in northern
  specimens, these wings are much suffused with darker grey, approaching
  blackish. The caterpillar is green with a yellowish or bluish tinge; a
  dusky line along the back, and a dark green line along the black-edged
  white spiracles. It feeds on dock, groundsel, plantain, and many other
  plants from April to July. The moth flies in September and October, and,
  except in Kent, and perhaps Sussex, is rather uncommon in the southern
  counties of England. It occurs, however, not infrequently in the eastern
  counties, and through Oxford, Berks, Gloucester, Somerset to Cornwall,
  and northward through Hereford and parts of the Midlands to Lancashire,
  Yorkshire, and Durham.</p>

<h5><b>The Grey Chi</b> (<i>Polia chi</i>).</h5>

  <p>Four specimens are depicted on Plate <a href="#plate138">138</a>.
  Figs. 2 and 3 represent the sexes of the type form, and Figs. 4 and 5,
  the greenish-grey var. <i>olivacea</i>, Stephens. Both forms may be paler
  or darker, but the green tinge is apt to fade out. Var. <i>suffusa</i>,
  Tutt, is a dark greyish suffused form. <!-- Page 287 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="435.png"><a name="page287"></a>{287}</span></p>

  <p>The caterpillar is green, inclining to bluish green above; the lines
  on the back are whitish, edged with dark green; that along the
  black-margined white spiracles is white, shaded above with dark green. It
  feeds on dock, dandelion, groundsel, etc.; also on sallow and hawthorn,
  from April to June. The moth is out in August and September. It prefers
  the open country to woodlands, and is often seen resting on rocks, stone,
  or other walls, and buildings. Except that it occurs in Devon and Dorset,
  the species seems to be absent in the south of England, but its area of
  distribution extends in the British Isles from the Midlands of England to
  Moray and Ross in Scotland, and to Ireland.</p>

<h5><b>The Black-banded</b> (<i>Polia xanthomista</i>).</h5>

  <p>The form of this species occurring in Britain is var.
  <i>nigrocincta</i>, Tr. (Plate <a href="#plate140">140</a>, Figs. 2, 3),
  which is pale grey, spotted with white, and clouded on the central area
  with black. The typical yellow flecking and dotting is in this form
  usually sparse, but occasionally it is prominent. A specimen reared from
  a caterpillar taken in the Isle of Man was suffused on the fore wings
  with bright orange.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is ochreous brown, varying in tint, above and pale
  green below the brown spiracles; the head is rather yellowish and very
  glossy. It feeds on sea thrift (flowers), and plantain in its haunts,
  which are the rocky coasts of Cornwall, North Devon, and the Isle of Man.
  In confinement it will eat groundsel, dock, dandelion, lettuce, etc.
  Usually the caterpillars do not hatch out until the spring, and then feed
  until June or July; but they have been known to hatch in the autumn, and
  then to hibernate. The moth flies in August and September, but, although
  it has been taken at sugar and light, is more frequently reared from
  caterpillars, which are readily found at night by those who may undertake
  the sometimes <!-- Page 288 --><span class="pagenum" title="436.png"><a
  name="page288"></a>{288}</span>hazardous business of collecting them. The
  earliest known British specimen was taken at a lighthouse near Padstow in
  Cornwall, and five years later the moth was bred from a caterpillar found
  in the Isle of Man. In 1880 a specimen was taken at sugar in the middle
  of a small wood in South Pembrokeshire. According to Hampson this, and
  the other two species usually included in <i>Polia</i>, are referable to
  <i>Antitype</i>, Hübn. On the same authority <i>nigrocincta</i>, Treit.,
  is the earlier name for the present species, as the figure of
  <i>xanthomista</i>, Hübn., was not published until 1827.</p>

<h5><b>The Sprawler</b> (<i>Brachionycha</i> (<i>Asteroscopus</i>) <i>sphinx</i>).</h5>

  <p>The black streaked and dotted, pale brownish grey moth (Plate <a
  href="#plate138">138</a>, Fig. 8) occurs, more or less locally, in most
  of the English counties from Norfolk, Huntingdon, and Oxford, southwards;
  and from Gloucester northwards through Hereford and Worcester, to
  Cheshire, Lancashire, Yorkshire, to Darlington in Durham, and Cumberland.
  It is, however, rare in the northern counties. The caterpillar is
  yellowish green; three whitish lines on the back, the central one broadly
  edged with green on both sides, and the others inwardly by a dark line;
  the front ring is edged with whitish, and the head is greenish. It feeds
  on the foliage of various trees, including oak, beech, elm, ash, sallow,
  lime in May and June. The moth flies in November and December.</p>

<h5><b>The Rannoch Sprawler</b> (<i>Brachionycha</i> (<i>Asteroscopus</i>)
<i>nubeculosa</i>).</h5>

  <p>The first British specimen was taken at Rannoch in the spring of 1854,
  and in that Perthshire locality the species is still to be found, sitting
  on the trunks of the birch trees in late March and in April. It has
  frequently been reared from the egg, but the caterpillars must be sleeved
  out on growing birch, or the mortality among them may be high. Even if
  they attain the chrysalis stage, the moth may not appear the following
  spring, as it has a habit of remaining in its shell for two winters, and
  sometimes more. (Plate <a href="#plate140">140</a>, Figs. 1&#x2642;,
  4&#x2640;.)</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is yellowish green, whiter on the back; the third ring
  is obliquely marked with yellow on each side; the eleventh ring is
  slightly raised and marked yellow, and there is an oblique yellow mark
  above the claspers; spiracles white edged with black, and the usual dots
  are pale yellow. It feeds on birch. May and June.</p>

<h5><b>The Green-brindled Crescent</b> (<i>Miselia oxyacanthæ</i>).</h5>

  <p>This moth, which in its typical form was known to the ancient fathers
  of entomology as "Ealing's Glory," is shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate141">141</a>, Fig. 2. The var. <i>capucina</i>, Mill (Fig.
  3), a purely British production by the way, has the fore wings dark sooty
  brown, inclining to blackish. The caterpillar, which has a white-marked
  and divided hump on ring eleven, is reddish or greyish brown, with dark
  grey and greenish mottling; the back has three darker lines along it, and
  there is a sort of diamond pattern in greyish between the outer ones;
  rings three and ten striped with black; head reddish brown. It feeds in
  April and May on hawthorn, sloe, crab, and apple. Widely distributed
  throughout the British Isles, but apparently not found north of Moray in
  Scotland.</p>

<h5><b>The Double-spot Brocade</b> (<i>Miselia bimaculosa</i>).</h5>

  <p>Stephens, referring to this species in 1829, states that he had only
  seen one British specimen. This was in the British Museum, "to which it
  was presented by Dr. Leach; it was captured near Bristol, I believe, in
  July, 1815." Barrett notes <!-- Page 290 --><span class="pagenum" title="440.png"
  ><a name="page290"></a>{290}</span>a specimen, said to have been taken by
  Peter Bouchard, in the collection of the late Dr. Mason. This is all that
  there seems to be known concerning this species in Britain. The specimen
  figured on Plate <a href="#plate141">141</a>, Fig. 4, is continental.</p>

<h5><b>The Merveille du Jour</b> (<i>Agriopis aprilina</i>).</h5>

  <p>The pretty green moth, with white-edged black markings, shown on Plate
  <a href="#plate141">141</a>, Fig. 1, is widely distributed over the
  greater part of the British Isles. It occurs in oak woods, or in
  localities where oak trees are plentiful. The caterpillar is of an
  obscure greenish-grey coloration, sometimes inclining to brownish; a
  white line along the back, and a dark one low down on the sides; over the
  back spreads a series of blackish marks showing a more or less diamond
  pattern. It feeds in the spring and until June on oak leaves, and often
  rests by day on the trunks, in the chinks of the bark. The moth flies in
  September and October, rather earlier in Scotland.</p>

<h5><b>Flame Brocade</b> (<i>Rhizotype</i> (<i>Trigonophora</i>) <i>flammea</i>).</h5>

  <p>The earliest record of this species (Plate <a
  href="#plate141">141</a>, Fig. 6) in England dates back to 1855, when
  five specimens were obtained at sugar in a locality near Brighton, in
  Sussex. The next year, and subsequently, it was found, not only in the
  original place, but also in the Lewes and Shoreham districts. Later it
  was met with in other localities in the county, and for several years
  captures were made in most of its known haunts. For some years past,
  however, it seems to have disappeared from Sussex, and is not known to
  occur in any other part of the British Isles.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is ochreous brown, tinged with reddish; a dull
  brownish diamond pattern, and three lines along the back, the central
  line paler than the others; the spiracles and usual dots are white,
  ringed with brownish. Another form is green, as also are both forms in
  the younger stages. It feeds from December to April on pilewort
  (<i>Ranunculus ficaria</i>), <i>R. repens</i>, and other kinds of
  buttercup. When full grown it is said to prefer ash or privet. The moth
  flies in late September and October.</p>

<h5><b>The Small Angle Shades</b> (<i>Euplexia lucipara</i>).</h5>

  <p>The pale reniform mark on the outer edge of the blackish central area
  is the prominent feature of this pinkish- or purplish-brown moth. (Plate
  <a href="#plate141">141</a>, Fig. 5.) The caterpillar is green, or
  pinkish-brown, and velvety in appearance; three indistinct lines and some
  dusky V-shaped marks on the back; a white line along the sides; usual
  dots white, and the spiracles black. It feeds in August and September on
  most low plants, birch, sallow, bracken, etc. It is often destructive to
  ferns in the garden or conservatory; usually selecting the choicer kinds,
  and as its depredations are carried on only at night, the culprit escapes
  detection. The moth flies in June and July, and a few specimens sometimes
  appear in the autumn. Generally distributed and often common in the
  South. The range abroad extends to Amurland, Japan, and North
  America.</p>

<h5><b>The Angle Shades</b> (<i>Phlogophora meticulosa</i>).</h5>

  <p>The moth shown on Plate <a href="#plate141">141</a>, Fig. 7, is, when
  newly emerged from the chrysalis, an exceedingly pretty creature. After
  death the pinky-brown colour remains, but the olive green of the
  triangular central band, and border of outer margin, fades and distinctly
  mars the pleasing effect of the general colour scheme. Sometimes the
  central band and outer border are red, and in such specimens the ground
  colour is more rosy. The caterpillar is green or brown, minutely dotted
  with white; a pale central line and dusky V-shaped marks on each side of
  it; the outer arm of the V more distinct than the inner; the line along
  the dark <!-- Page 292 --><span class="pagenum" title="444.png"><a
  name="page292"></a>{292}</span>ringed spiracles whitish; head green or
  brown freckled with darker. It feeds on groundsel, dock, bracken, and
  almost anything in the way of an herbaceous plant; often attacks
  geraniums in the greenhouse as well as outdoors. Has been found in almost
  every month of the year, but perhaps most common in July, August, and
  September. The moth also occurs at all seasons of the year, but seems to
  be most frequent in May and June, and sometimes in September and October.
  It is found throughout the British Isles. Both this species and the last
  mentioned, when resting on herbage, paling, or tree stem, chiefly the
  former, sit with the wings folded in to the body, but each fore wing is
  broadly wrinkled or folded throughout its length. In this position the
  moth is very like a crumpled decaying leaf, and for such may be readily
  mistaken.</p>

<h5><b>The Old Lady</b> (<i>Mania</i> (<i>Mormo</i>) <i>maura</i>).</h5>

  <p>From its habit of creeping behind curtains, shutters, etc., and
  otherwise disposing itself in dwelling-houses during the day, as well as
  in summer houses and other buildings, this moth (Plate <a
  href="#plate142">142</a>, Figs. 1&#x2642;, 3&#x2640;) must often come
  under observation. The caterpillar is ochreous brown with a darker
  diamond pattern on the back; the central line is ochreous, but much
  broken, and on each side of it there is a series of pale oblique streaks;
  the spiracles are reddish ochreous, edged with black, and the line along
  them is ochreous; head pale brown, glossy. The general colour varies to
  greyish or purplish brown. It feeds on various low herbage in the autumn,
  and on the young shoots and leaves of sallow, hawthorn, birch, etc., in
  the spring after hibernation. The moth flies in July and August, and is
  generally common in the south of England. Sometimes it abounds even in
  the London suburbs, and in 1904 it was seen pretty frequently during
  August flying, in the evening, low down along the roads and in gardens
  all over the southern district. The species is also <!-- Page 293
  --><span class="pagenum" title="445.png"><a
  name="page293"></a>{293}</span>found more or less frequently throughout
  England northwards, and well into Scotland, as least as far as
  Clydesdale. Renton records it as common at sugar in Roxburghshire, and
  White gives the Forth and Tay districts. Widely distributed in Ireland,
  common in some parts.</p>

<h5><b>The Gothic</b> (<i>Nænia typica</i>).</h5>

  <p>This moth (Plate <a href="#plate142">142</a>, Fig. 2) is common in
  gardens, as well as along the weedy wayside and hedgerow in all parts of
  England and Wales, Scotland to Sutherland, and in Ireland. The
  caterpillar (Plate <a href="#plate139">139</a>, Fig. 2) varies in colour
  from brownish-grey to pale ochreous brown, or greenish grey, freckled
  with darker; three pale lines on the first ring, and partly on the
  second; some pale oblique streaks on the sides, and blackish marks on
  rings ten and eleven, the latter more or less united behind; head of the
  body colour darker marked. It feeds on all kinds of herbage, also on the
  leaves of sallow, sloe, apple, etc. When young in large companies on the
  underside of leaves. August to May. The moth flies in June and July.</p>

<h5><b>The Crescent</b> (<i>Helotropha leucostigma</i>).</h5>

  <p>Of this purplish-brown species the typical form (Fig. 1), and the pale
  banded form, var. <i>fibrosa</i>, Hübn., are shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate143">143</a>. The caterpillar, according to Buckler, is slaty
  brown, inclining to olive drab above; three paler lines on the back; the
  spiracles are black and the usual dots black-brown; head warm brown, very
  glossy; plate on first ring glossy black, that on the last ring blackish
  brown. It feeds in the stems of <i>Cladium mariscus</i>, sedge (<i>Carex
  paludosa</i>), and yellow flag (<i>Iris pseudacorus</i>). May to July.
  The moth is out in late June, July, and August. It inhabits fens and
  marshy ground, and seems to be found in such localities throughout the
  British Isles, including the <!-- Page 294 --><span class="pagenum" title="446.png"
  ><a name="page294"></a>{294}</span>Hebrides and Shetlands. Abroad the
  range extends to Amurland, China, Japan, also North America.</p>

<h5><b>The Ear Moth</b> (<i>Hydr&oelig;cia</i> (<i>Gortyna</i>) <i>nictitans</i>).</h5>

  <p>On Plate <a href="#plate143">143</a> are shown a more or less typical
  specimen of this species (Fig. 3); the reddish spotted var.
  <i>erythrostigma</i>, Haw. (Fig. 4); and two examples of the marsh or
  saltern form, <i>paludis</i>, Tutt (Figs. 5, 6), for which specific rank
  has been claimed. Specimens found in marshes, especially those by the
  sea, are usually somewhat larger than normal, but I cannot see that they
  otherwise differ from forms of <i>nictitans</i>. The caterpillar is
  greenish pink with pinkish grey stripes on the back and sides; spiracles
  black, and usual dots dark brownish; head pinkish ochreous, plate on ring
  one of the body yellowish brown. It feeds from May to August on grasses,
  chiefly the lower part of the stems. The moth flies in August and
  September, and is sometimes seen in the daytime on the flowers of thistle
  and ragwort, etc., but far more frequently at night, when it also visits
  sugar more or less freely. Usually common in marshy places throughout our
  islands. The range abroad extends to Amurland, Corea, Japan, and North
  America.</p>

<h5><b>The Rosy Rustic</b> (<i>Hydr&oelig;cia</i> (<i>Gortyna</i>) <i>micacea</i>).</h5>

  <p>This moth (Plate <a href="#plate143">143</a>, Figs. 8, 9) is also
  widely spread over the British Isles, occurring most freely on the coast,
  but not uncommonly inland. It appears in the autumn, and is frequently
  seen at light, and although not very partial to sugar it occasionally
  visits that attraction as well as ragwort blossom, etc. The caterpillar
  is dull smoky pink, with a faintly darker central stripe; the usual dots
  dark brown, and the spiracles black; head, and plates on first and last
  rings of the body ochreous brown. May to August on dock, plantain,
  feeding in the stems and down into the roots. Sometimes it attacks the
  potato, eating down the stalk into the tuber. The range abroad extends to
  Amurland.</p>

<h5><b>The Butterbur</b> (<i>Hydr&oelig;cia</i> (<i>Gortyna</i>) <i>petasitis</i>).</h5>

  <p>This is a larger species than the last, and more dingy in coloration.
  Its chief haunts, among the butterbur (<i>Petasites</i>), are in the
  northern counties from Cheshire to Durham. It was first met with by
  Stainton in 1846 at Falkirk in Scotland, and Doubleday named and
  described it in 1847. An account of its caterpillar feeding in the roots
  of the butterbur was published by N. Cooke in 1850, and by 1855 the
  northern collectors had reared and distributed large numbers of the moths
  among their confrères in other parts of the country. The species is still
  common in the north of England, but continues scarce and very local in
  Scotland. Odd specimens have been reported from the eastern counties and
  once from Somerset. The caterpillar is greyish white with black dots;
  head, and plate on first ring of the body brown. July and August. The
  moth occurs among its food plant in August and September. (Plate <a
  href="#plate143">143</a>, Fig. 7.)</p>

<h5><b>The Frosted Orange</b> (<i>Ochria ochracea</i>).</h5>

  <p>Except that it sometimes visits a strong light, and may then be
  captured, this moth (Plate <a href="#plate144">144</a>, Figs. 1&#x2642;,
  2&#x2640;) is most easily obtained in its early stages. The caterpillar
  is pale ochreous white with conspicuous black dots; head ochreous brown,
  the plate on first ring of the body is blackish with white lines upon it.
  It feeds in the stems of thistles, burdock, hemp-agrimony, etc. April to
  July, or later. The brownish chrysalis may be found in stems of the
  plants, generally low down near the ground. The moth, also known as
  <i>flavago</i>, Schiff., occurs from August to October in most places,
  especially marshy ground, where <!-- Page 296 --><span class="pagenum" title="450.png"
  ><a name="page296"></a>{296}</span>thistles flourish, throughout England
  and Wales. It is found in Scotland up to Perthshire and Aberdeen. Only
  recorded from Wicklow, Galway, Sligo, and Clare, in Ireland.</p>

<h5><b>Reed Wainscot</b> (<i>Nonagria algæ</i> (<i>cannæ</i>)).</h5>

  <p>This moth (Plate <a href="#plate144">144</a>, Fig. 4) varies in size
  and also in the colour of the fore wings, which range from a pale
  ochreous, through reddish shades, to sooty brown. The cross lines are
  indicated by black dots. The black dotted greenish caterpillar has a
  brown head and a whitish green plate on first ring of the body. It feeds
  from May to July in the stems of reed-mace (<i>Typha latifolia</i>),
  often called the bulrush or catstail; also in the true bulrush
  (<i>Scirpus lacustris</i>). Fig. 5, Plate <a href="#plate148">148</a>,
  shows the chrysalis in its characteristic position when in the stem, that
  is with the head upwards. The moth flies, in August and September, at
  dusk, over and among the reeds; the males especially freely responding to
  the attraction of light. Its chief localities are in the fens of Norfolk
  and Suffolk, but it has also occurred in Mid-Sussex.</p>

<h5><b>Webb's Wainscot</b> (<i>Nonagria sparganii</i>).</h5>

  <p>This moth also varies in the colour of the fore wings, from almost
  whitish through various shades of ochreous and red. The main veins are
  shaded with grey, and the median one has black dots upon it, chiefly at
  the end of the cell; the outer margin with a row of large or small black
  dots. (Plate <a href="#plate144">144</a>, Fig. 3.) The caterpillar is
  yellowish green with darker lines; head and plate on first ring of the
  body pale brown. It feeds in July and August in stems of bur-reed
  (<i>Sparganium</i>), reed-mace, and yellow flag. Fig. 6, Plate <a
  href="#plate148">148</a>, shows the chrysalis in its natural position in
  the stem. The hole in the stem from which the moth escapes is also
  clearly in evidence above the chrysalis. <!-- Page 297 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="451.png"><a name="page297"></a>{297}</span>The
  moth flies among reeds, etc., in August and September. Its chief
  localities in England are in East and South-east Kent, in which county
  the first British specimens were obtained by Mr. Sydney Webb in 1879. In
  1899 a specimen reared from a caterpillar found in a stem of
  <i>Typha</i>, was recorded from Suffolk (Woodbridge district); and in
  1901 the species was recorded from South Devon. It is also not uncommon
  "between Old Head of Kinsale and Glandore," Co. Cork, Ireland.</p>

<h5><b>The Bulrush Wainscot</b> (<i>Nonagria typhæ</i>).</h5>

  <p>The fore wings of this species (Plate <a href="#plate144">144</a>,
  Fig. 5), usually of a pale whity-brown colour, in some specimens are
  reddish tinged; or they may be almost uniformly reddish brown or blackish
  (var. <i>fraterna</i>, Treit.). The row of black spots on the outer area
  are wedge-shaped and are placed just before the margin. The caterpillar
  is pale ochreous more or less tinged with pink; a paler line along the
  spiracles; head and plate on first ring of the body red-brown. July to
  August, in stems of <i>Typha</i>. The moth flies in August and September,
  and although it may be netted when on the wing at dusk, or at light, it
  is obtained in better condition by rearing it from the chrysalis, which
  may be found in the stems (Plate <a href="#plate148">148</a>, Fig. 3),
  those of the previous year for choice, of reed mace. Generally
  distributed in England up to Yorkshire; it has been recorded also from
  Northumberland and the Scottish border. It is common in southern Ireland,
  and found northwards up to Sligo, Tyrone, and Armagh.</p>

<h5><b>The Twin-spotted</b> (<i>Nonagria geminipuncta</i>).</h5>

  <p>This species, shown on Plate <a href="#plate144">144</a>, Figs. 6, 7,
  varies in colour from pale brown, more or less suffused with grey,
  through darker, or reddish brown to blackish (var. <i>nigricans</i>,
  Staud.). <!-- Page 298 --><span class="pagenum" title="452.png"><a
  name="page298"></a>{298}</span>In the brown typical form the reniform
  mark is represented by two dark-edged white dots, the upper one often
  tiny or absent (var. <i>unipuncta</i>, Tutt), or both may be absent (var.
  <i>obsoleta</i>, Tutt). The caterpillar in pale ochreous, pink-tinged, a
  pale line along the spiracles; head dark brown. May and June, in stems of
  reeds (<i>Phragmites</i>). The chrysalis lies in the reed stem with the
  head towards the oval hole above it from which the moth escapes. In
  August the moth may be found in its haunts in the south and east of
  England. These are marshes, often near the sea, in Cambridgeshire,
  Suffolk, Essex, the Thames valley, Sussex, Hants, and the Isle of Wight,
  Wiltshire and Somerset.</p>

<h5><b>The Brown-veined Wainscot</b> (<i>Nonagria dissoluta</i>).</h5>

  <p>The popular name applies more especially to the ordinary form of this
  species known as <i>arundineta</i>, Schmidt. (Plate <a
  href="#plate144">144</a>, Fig. 8.) The dark brown or black typical form
  (<i>dissoluta</i>, Treit. = <i>hessii</i>, Boisd.) is local and uncommon;
  in fact until 1900 it had not been noted in England for a number of
  years, and specimens were only known from Yaxley. In the year just
  mentioned however, several examples of it were recorded from Suffolk,
  taken in the Needham Market district; and in 1905 specimens were reported
  from the East Kent marshes. Var. <i>arundineta</i>, the <i>neurica</i> of
  some authors, occurs in the fens of Norfolk, Suffolk, Cambridge, and
  Lincolnshire; also in marshes in Essex and Kent; and is said to have been
  taken in Middlesex and Lancashire. The caterpillar is dirty white, light
  reddish on the back; raised dots black inclining to brown on front three
  rings; spiracles white edged with black; head dark brown; plate on first
  and last rings of the body brownish grey. It feeds in June in the stems
  of reed and turns to a chrysalis in the lower part of the stem, head
  downwards in the direction of the exit hole below it. (Plate <a
  href="#plate148">148</a>, Fig. 1.) The moth flies in July and August.</p>

<h5><b>The Small Rufous</b> (<i>C&oelig;nobia rufa</i>).</h5>

  <p>Varies from pale ochreous white, through reddish shades, to a greyish
  brown. (Plate <a href="#plate145">145</a>, Figs. 9 to 11.) The
  caterpillar is described by Hofmann, as pale reddish above and whitish
  below, with minute dark dots on the back and a fine blackish line along
  the sides; head and plate on first ring of the body brown and glossy. May
  and June, in stems of the jointed rush (<i>Juncus lamprocarpus</i>). The
  moth flies in July and August, and occurs in fens and marshes. At one
  time it was not uncommon in marshy localities around London, and it is
  still to be obtained in Richmond Park, Surrey. In some years it abounds
  in the Norfolk and Cambridge fens, and in others is hardly seen. It is
  also to be found more or less frequently but always local in Suffolk,
  Essex, Berks, Kent, Sussex, Isle of Wight, Dorset (Isle of Purbeck),
  Devon, Somerset, Gloucester, North and South Wales, Cheshire, and
  Yorkshire; Argyllshire in Scotland; Ireland.</p>

<h5><b>The Silky Wainscot</b> (<i>Senta maritima</i>).</h5>

  <p>In its typical form (Fig. 7) the moth shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate145">145</a> is whity-brown, clouded with grey and sometimes
  tinged with brownish on the disc. The orbicular and reniform stigmata are
  round and faintly outlined in whitish. In var. <i>bipunctata</i>,
  Haworth, the stigmata are black and conspicuous: var.
  <i>wismariensis</i>, Schmidt, has a blackish central streak from the base
  broadening out towards the outer margin (Fig. 8): var.
  <i>nigristriata</i>, Staud., has the fore-wings finely streaked with
  black; and var. <i>nigrocostata</i>, Staud., has the front margin broadly
  black. The caterpillar is ochreous grey with three fine interrupted,
  whitish lines on the back; spiracles black with darker lines along their
  area; head dark brown and shining. September to May, hiding by day in
  stems of reed (<i>Phragmites</i>) and at night <!-- Page 300 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="456.png"><a name="page300"></a>{300}</span>feeding
  on the caterpillars and chrysalids of other reed insects (Hofmann). The
  moth flies from late June to early August. It occurs in the fens of
  Norfolk and Cambridge, but in the former county it has been taken at
  Merton and King's Lynn. Dr. Wheeler states that it is usually found in
  the thicker reed beds where stems of the previous year's growth still
  remain. Specimens were obtained among reeds in the Harwich district,
  Essex, in 1902, and the species has also been recorded from Tring,
  Hertfordshire, Surrey, Sussex, and the Isle of Wight.</p>

<h5><b>The Flame Wainscot</b> (<i>Meliana flammea</i>).</h5>

  <p>The original British specimen, which Curtis in 1829 named, described,
  and figured, was stated to have been taken "near Lewisham, towards Lee,
  in July." Now it is only known to occur in Huntingdon, Norfolk, and
  Cambridgeshire, chiefly in the fens; in Wicken fen in the latter county
  it is most plentiful. (Plate <a href="#plate145">145</a>, Figs. 5, 6.)
  The caterpillar is greyish ochreous brown, rather paler beneath, with
  paler lines along the back and sides, the central one edged on each side
  with darker; spiracles whitish, outlined with black, and a greyish drab
  spiracular stripe with paler edges; head shining, and faintly netted with
  darker grey. (Condensed from Buckler.) Hides by day in the old stems of
  reed (<i>Phragmites</i>), and feeds at night on the leaves, August to
  October.</p>

<h5><b>The Small Wainscot</b> (<i>Tapinostola fulva</i>).</h5>

  <p>The fore wings vary in colour from almost whitish through various
  shades of grey brown and reddish brown (Plate <a
  href="#plate145">145</a>, Figs. 12 to 14). The caterpillar, pale shining
  pinkish ochreous; central stripe pale, bordered on each side with greyish
  brown. Head pale brown, marked with darker, shining. June and July in
  stems of sedges (<i>Carex</i>). The moth flies in August and <!-- Page
  301 --><span class="pagenum" title="457.png"><a
  name="page301"></a>{301}</span>September, and is found in fens and marshy
  ground pretty well all over the British Isles, including the
  Hebrides.</p>

<h5><b>The Concolorous</b> (<i>Tapinostola extrema</i>).</h5>

  <p>This species (Plate <a href="#plate146">146</a>, Fig. 3) was at one
  time subsequent to 1844, when it was first discovered in Yaxley Fen, not
  at all scarce in that locality and in other fens in Huntingdonshire and
  Cambridgeshire. It then disappeared from all its old haunts, some of
  which were destroyed; but a few years since it was met with again in
  Hunts, and apparently not uncommonly.</p>

<h5><b>Bond's Wainscot</b> (<i>Tapinostola bondii</i>).</h5>

  <p>The whitish moth shown on Plate <a href="#plate146">146</a>, Fig. 4,
  was first taken at Folkestone, Kent, by Dr. Knaggs, in 1859, and named
  and described by him in 1861. It still occurs in that locality and also
  on the Devon and Dorsetshire coast, the known localities being Charmouth,
  Lyme Regis, and Sidmouth.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is dirty white in colour inclining to brownish at each
  end; a whitish line along the middle of the back; head brown. Feeds from
  August to June in stems of <i>Festuca arundinacea</i>. The moth flies in
  June and July.</p>

<h5><b>The Mere Wainscot</b> (<i>Tapinostola hellmanni</i>).</h5>

  <p>Present localities for this reddish species (Plate <a
  href="#plate146">146</a>, Figs. 1, 2) are Wicken and Chippenham fens,
  Chatteris and Whittlesford, in Cambridgeshire; Monk's Wood in Hunts.
  Formerly Yaxley, where it was first taken in 1847, used to be a noted
  locality, but the insect disappeared when the fen was drained. It has
  been reported from Norfolk (Yarmouth), Lincolnshire, Devonshire
  (Dartmoor), and Hertfordshire (Hitchin), chiefly in odd specimens. The
  caterpillar has been described by Hofmann as yellowish-white, or reddish
  above and paler beneath; plate <!-- Page 302 --><span class="pagenum" title="458.png"
  ><a name="page302"></a>{302}</span>on first ring of the body rather
  glossy, head glossy yellow brown. It lives from autumn to June of the
  next year in stems of the wood smallreed (<i>Calamagrostis epigeios</i>).
  The moth flies in July and August.</p>

<h5><b>The Lyme Grass</b> (<i>Tapinostola elymi</i>).</h5>

  <p>The more or less brownish-tinged, whitish-ochreous species shown on
  Plate <a href="#plate146">146</a>, Figs. 5, 6, was not recorded as a
  British insect until 1861. It is now known to occur in England in many
  localities, but all on the east coast from Norfolk to Durham. In the
  <i>Entomologist</i> for 1894, it is recorded as occurring at Montrose on
  the Forfarshire coast in Scotland. The caterpillar is described by
  Buckler as pale flesh colour, with a rather darker stripe along the back;
  spiracles black; head reddish-brown, shining; shining yellowish-brown
  plates on the first and last rings of the body. It feeds on the stems of
  lyme-grass (<i>Elymus arenarius</i>) in May and June. The moth flies at
  early dusk over and among its food plants, and later on it settles on the
  stems, from which it may be easily boxed.</p>

<h5><b>The Brighton Wainscot</b> (<i>Oria</i> (<i>Synia</i>) <i>musculosa</i>).</h5>

  <p>This yellowish-clouded, whitish insect is a native of Southern Europe,
  Asia Minor, Syria, and North-west Africa. Occasionally it has occurred in
  England, and in the time of Haworth and Stephens one or two specimens
  seem to have been recorded as British. In 1855 an example was captured at
  Brighton, and others occurred in the same locality, and at Bexhill, Kent
  (Jenner), between that year and 1860. A specimen was recorded from
  Brighton in 1883, and one from South Devon in 1899. Reported from
  Wiltshire in 1910. (Plate <a href="#plate146">146</a>, Fig. 7.)</p>

<h5><b>The Large Wainscot</b> (<i>Calamia lutosa</i>).</h5>

  <p>This species, shown on Plate <a href="#plate145">145</a>, Figs. 1, 2,
  varies somewhat in the colour of the fore wings, which is usually pale
  ochreous brown, but may be more or less reddish tinged, or clouded with
  dusky; there is a row of black dots beyond the middle of the wing, but
  these are sometimes faint or absent. The range in size is considerable,
  some specimens are about the size of <i>L. straminea</i> whilst others
  will equal that of a large <i>N. typhæ</i>.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is whitish tinged with pink above, and with a dusky
  line along the back; head reddish brown and glossy; plates on first and
  last rings of the body shining pale brown. It feeds from April to June in
  the stems of reed (<i>Phragmites</i>), causing the leaves of the affected
  stems to whiten. The moth flies in August, September, and October,
  sometimes later, and occurs in marshes, and on the banks of streams and
  ditches, in most of the southern and eastern counties of England, and
  from Derbyshire to Durham; in Scotland it has been recorded from
  Roxburghshire (near Kelso, rare), Perthshire, Aberdeen, and Shetland. The
  species is widely spread in Ireland.</p>

<h5><b>The Fen Wainscot</b> (<i>Calamia phragmitidis</i>).</h5>

  <p>In the typical form this species (Plate <a href="#plate145">145</a>,
  Figs. 3, 4) the fore wings are whitish on the basal half, and incline to
  reddish on the outer half; var. <i>rufescens</i>, Tutt, has these wings
  reddish all over, but somewhat darker on the outer margin. The
  caterpillar is ochreous white with a slightly paler stripe along the
  back, edged on each side with purplish; the spots are black, as also are
  the spiracles; head and plates on the first and last rings of the body
  black or blackish brown, glossy. It feeds from August to June in stems of
  reed (<i>Phragmites</i>), and is said <!-- Page 304 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="462.png"><a name="page304"></a>{304}</span>to
  hatch from the egg in the autumn. The moth flies in July and August, and
  is fond of the flowers of grasses growing in its marshy haunts. It is
  common in the Norfolk and Cambridge fens, and is found in suitable
  locations in Huntingdon, Northampton, Lincoln, Yorkshire, Cheshire, and
  South Lancashire, also in Berkshire, Suffolk, Essex, Kent, and
  Sussex.</p>

<h5><b>The Common Wainscot</b> (<i>Leucania pallens</i>).</h5>

  <p>This common, often abundant species (Plate <a
  href="#plate147">147</a>, Figs. 1, 2) is pretty generally distributed
  over the British Isles. The typical coloration is pale ochreous; ab.
  <i>arcuata</i>, Stephens, is pale brownish ochreous; ab. <i>ectypa</i>,
  Hübn. = <i>rufescens</i>, Haworth, is reddish; and ab. <i>suffusa</i>,
  Stephens, is also reddish, but powdered with blackish scales between the
  veins, and chiefly so under the median nervure. The hind wings in all
  forms are white in both sexes; but sometimes slightly tinged with greyish
  on the outer margin in the female. The caterpillar (Plate <a
  href="#plate152">152</a>, Fig. 1) which feeds on grasses from August to
  May, is pale whity-brown freckled above with pinkish brown; three whitish
  lines along the back, the central one narrowly edged on each side, and
  the others on the inner side only, with blackish; a greyish stripe along
  the sides with two pinkish brown lines above it; dots, minute, black;
  head freckled with dark brown. Distribution abroad extends to
  Amurland.</p>

<h5><b>Mathew's Wainscot</b> (<i>Leucania favicolor</i>).</h5>

  <p>This species (Plate <a href="#plate149">149</a>, Figs. 1, 2) has been
  mainly found on the coasts of North-east Essex and South-east Suffolk,
  but it has also been taken at Hemley in Suffolk, and has been recorded
  from near Southend in Essex, and Rochester in Kent. In 1906 six specimens
  were captured in the Isle of Sheppey. So far as is known at present this
  is its range in England, and it does not seem to occur anywhere abroad.
  It was first discovered by Paymaster-in-Chief G. F. Mathew, in 1895, and
  was described by the late Mr. C. G. Barrett in 1896.</p>

  <p>In the typical form the fore wings are of a smooth soft honey colour,
  or colour of the honeycomb, having the nervures faintly perceptible, but
  not paler; a black discal dot, and two more dots with some faint blackish
  dashes indicate the usual second line. Tutt has named several forms, the
  most important being ab. <i>lutea</i>, bright yellow buff with discal dot
  and two dots beyond; and ab. <i>rufa</i>, deep reddish with discal dot
  and two others beyond. Besides these there are ab. <i>ænea</i>, Mathew,
  deep orange, with only one dot representing second line; and ab.
  <i>obscura</i>, Mathew, cinnamon-brown, with smoky shading between some
  of the nervures. The hind wings vary from whitish with darker nervures,
  to smoky grey; but the fringes always remain whitish.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is a warm putty colour, or pinkish brown, mottled and
  shaded with darker shades; three pale whitish brown lines on the back,
  the central one bordered on each side by a darker shade, and the outer
  ones shaded inwardly with darker and edged below by a darker line; a
  brown or pinkish stripe above the spiracles, and a pinkish yellow stripe
  below them; head yellowish-brown, shining, and dotted with darker colour.
  It feeds on grasses from July to April (adapted from Mathew). The moth
  flies in June and July, and frequents the flowers of the large grasses
  growing on salt marshes. Sometimes specimens of a second brood appear in
  August or September.</p>

<h5><b>The Smoky Wainscot</b> (<i>Leucania impura</i>).</h5>

  <p>The range of this common species (Plate <a href="#plate147">147</a>,
  Figs. 3&#x2642;, 4&#x2640;), in the British Isles is almost the same as
  that of <i>L. pallens</i>, but it does not extend further north than
  Moray in Scotland. The hind wings are greyish or blackish grey. A form
  with reddish <!-- Page 306 --><span class="pagenum" title="466.png"><a
  name="page306"></a>{306}</span>fore wings is var. <i>punctina</i>, Haw.,
  which sometimes has a row of black dots on the outer margin. The
  caterpillar is greyish ochreous above, greenish tinged beneath; a brown
  stripe along the middle of the back is intersected by a very fine white
  line; above the reddish black-edged spiracles is a brownish stripe; usual
  dots black; head pale brown, shining, netted with brown and lined with
  blackish. It feeds on grasses from August to May. The moth is out in July
  and August; rather later in the north. Distribution abroad extends to
  Amurland and Japan.</p>

<h5><b>The Southern Wainscot</b> (<i>Leucania straminea</i>).</h5>

  <p>In its more usual form this species (Plate <a
  href="#plate147">147</a>, Fig. 5) has pale whity-brown or pale
  straw-coloured fore wings, and the black dots forming the second line not
  infrequently absent, at least as regards some of them. Var.
  <i>rufolinea</i>, Tutt, has the fore wings reddish ochreous, the rays
  whitish, and the shade under the median nervure reddish. Var.
  <i>nigrostriata</i>, Tutt, has the ground colour of the fore wings
  obscured by a thick powdering of black scales. The hind wings in all
  forms are whitish, sometimes greyish tinged. Generally there is a central
  black dot, and a more or less complete series of black dots beyond it;
  but some, or all, of these dots may be absent. The caterpillar, which
  feeds on the leaves of reeds, <i>Phalaris</i>, and other coarse grasses
  from October to May, is ochreous with an orange tinge, and dusted with
  grey; three white lines on the back are broadly shaded with bluish grey;
  on the sides are two grey shaded white lines; head shining brownish
  ochreous (Fenn). The moth flies in July and August, sometimes
  earlier.</p>

  <p>Hammersmith Marshes, a once noted locality for this, the Obscure
  Wainscot, and other good species, have long since been built over; but
  the present insect, and perhaps some of the other ancient inhabitants of
  the said marshes, possibly still occur along the banks of the Thames.
  Anyhow, it does lower <!-- Page 307 --><span class="pagenum" title="467.png"
  ><a name="page307"></a>{307}</span>down in the Kentish marshes. It is
  found in most of the eastern counties from Essex to Huntington and
  Lincoln, and also, but less frequent, in Sussex, Devon, and Cornwall.
  Kane gives Dromoland, Co. Clare, and Enniskillen, Co. Fermanagh,
  Ireland.</p>

<h5><b>The Striped Wainscot</b> (<i>Leucania impudens</i>).</h5>

  <p>This is a rather larger insect than either of the last four species.
  The fore wings are whitish ochreous, powdered with blackish scales, and
  often tinged with pinkish. The black shading along the median nervure is
  sometimes very conspicuous. The caterpillar is ochreous brown, with three
  blackish-edged whitish lines on the back and dark stripes along the
  sides; head pale brown marked with darker. It feeds on the leaves of the
  reed (<i>Phragmites</i>) in June. The moth flies in July and August in
  fens, boggy heaths, and marshy ground, and is found in such places in
  most of the eastern counties, in Yorkshire, and from Berkshire and Kent
  to Devon, also in South Wales and in Galway, Cork, and Kerry, Ireland.
  Abroad the range extends to Siberia and Amurland. (Plate <a

<h5><b>The Obscure Wainscot</b> (<i>Leucania obsoleta</i>).</h5>

  <p>This species (Plate <a href="#plate147">147</a>, Figs. 7&#x2642;,
  8&#x2640;) will be recognized by the fine blackish lines on the fore
  wings, the white dot at lower end of the cell, and the row of black dots
  representing the second cross line. It is a very local species, chiefly
  found among reeds in Norfolk and Cambridgeshire, and may also occur in
  marshy places along the banks of the Thames from Bucks to Kent. The
  caterpillar is greyish ochreous above and paler beneath; three white
  lines on the back, the central one edged with greenish on each side, and
  the others edged with brownish; the line along the black-edged spiracles
  is greyish; head pale <!-- Page 308 --><span class="pagenum" title="468.png"
  ><a name="page308"></a>{308}</span>brown striped with darker. It feeds
  from August to October on the leaves of the reed (<i>Phragmites</i>),
  hiding by day in the stems. It also hibernates in the reeds when full
  grown, but does not change to the chrysalis state until the spring. The
  moth flies in June and July.</p>

<h5><b>The Shore Wainscot</b> (<i>Leucania littoralis</i>).</h5>

  <p>The white line running through the pale ochreous brown fore wings is
  the chief character of this species. (Plate <a href="#plate150">150</a>,
  Figs. 4, 5.) The caterpillar (Plate <a href="#plate152">152</a>, Fig. 2)
  is whity-brown with three lines on the back, the central one is whitish,
  shaded with dusky on each side, the others brown edged with whitish; the
  spiracles are whitish, outlined in blackish; head, and plate on first
  ring of the body, bone colour, shining. It feeds from August to May on
  marram grass (<i>Psamma arenaria</i>), but will eat meadow grass
  (<i>Poa</i>) and other kinds in confinement. The moth is out in June and
  July, sometimes earlier or later. It is a coast species, occurring only
  on sandhills where the marram grass flourishes, and in such localities is
  found all round England and Wales; on the east coast of Scotland to
  Forfarshire, and on the west to Clydesdale and Arran; and in Ireland on
  the north, south, and east coasts.</p>

<h5><b>Fenn's Wainscot</b> (<i>Leucania brevilinea</i>).</h5>

  <p>On Plate <a href="#plate144">144</a>, Fig. 9 represents the type of
  this specimen, and Fig. 10 ab. <i>sinelinea</i>, Farn. This form, which
  has also been referred to as "<i>alinea</i>," is without the typical
  black streak at the base of the fore wings. The caterpillar is pale
  pinkish grey; dorsal line pale yellow or bone colour; subdorsal stripes
  of the same colour, edged on each side by a grey line, and each divided
  down the middle by a slender pale brown line; spiracular stripe of a dull
  opaque yellowish white edged above with grey; head, and plate on the
  first ring of the body, pale brown, the latter striped with pale yellow
  (Barrett). It feeds in the upper part of reed stems until nearly full
  grown, and then upon the leaves. April to July. Barrett states that it
  prefers the reeds near small trees or bushes to those growing in masses.
  The moth is out in July and August, and may be netted as it flies at dusk
  along the edges of the reed beds, etc.; later on it resorts to the
  honeydew-covered leaves of sallow and alder, and also visits light. This
  species was first taken in 1864 at Ranworth in Norfolk; it is now
  obtained in Barton Broad and several other localities in the Norfolk
  fens, but not in any other part of the British Isles. It does not appear
  to occur abroad.</p>

<h5><b>The Shoulder-striped Wainscot</b> (<i>Leucania</i> (<i>Cirphis</i>)
<i>comma</i>).</h5>

  <p>The striking features of this moth (Plate <a href="#plate147">147</a>,
  Fig. 10) are the white median nervure, and the black streak below it, of
  the fore wings; there are also black marks on the veins before the outer
  margin. The caterpillar is very like that of <i>L. impura</i>, but there
  is a dark line on the back between the central and outer whitish lines.
  It feeds on cocksfoot and other grasses from June to August. The moth
  flies in June and July, and is not uncommon in meadows and grassy places,
  even by the roadside. Except that it does not, apparently, extend beyond
  Perthshire in Scotland, it seems to be widely, or even generally,
  distributed over the British Isles. Abroad it ranges to Siberia and
  Amurland.</p>

  <p><i>Leucania l-album.</i>&mdash;Barrett, "Lepidoptera of the British
  Islands," vol. ix. p. 450 (1904), remarks: "This species now seems to
  have made its way to this country, though it is still doubtful whether it
  has established itself. Mr. Eustace R. Bankes has captured a female
  specimen in South Devon, and he mentions the occurrence of one or two
  other specimens. It is a very pretty species, and widely distributed
  abroad." <!-- Page 310 --><span class="pagenum" title="472.png"><a
  name="page310"></a>{310}</span></p>

<h5><b>The Devonshire Wainscot</b> (<i>Leucania</i> (<i>Cirphis</i>) <i>putrescens</i>).</h5>

  <p>So far as the British distribution of this species (Plate <a
  href="#plate147">147</a>, Fig. 9) is known, it seems to be confined to
  the coasts of South Devon and South Wales. It was first noted at Torquay
  in the year 1859, and about twelve years later was detected in
  Carmarthenshire. Abroad it occurs somewhat locally in France, Italy,
  Dalmatia, and in North-west Africa.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is pale brown with three whitish lines on the back,
  the central one edged on each side with blackish, the others shaded above
  with blackish with black dots in the shading, and edged below by a
  blackish line; all these lines become faint on the last three rings of
  the body; the usual dots are black; head rather paler, somewhat shiny,
  the lobes conspicuously edged with black, and the jaws marked with
  blackish. It feeds on grasses from September to January. The figure on
  Plate <a href="#plate148">148</a>, Fig. 7, is from one of a few
  caterpillars kindly sent by Mr. J. Walker, of Torquay. He writes: "They
  are full fed by the beginning of January as a rule, and although they go
  down, they do not turn until the beginning of June." Mine unfortunately
  died in the cocoon. The moth flies in July and August, and favours
  particular coves and banks by the sea. It visits sugar, and also the
  flowers of wild sage.</p>

<h5><b>The White-speck or American Wainscot</b> (<i>Leucania</i>
(<i>Cirphis</i>) <i>unipuncta</i>).</h5>

  <p>This moth (Plate <a href="#plate149">149</a>, Fig. 4) is known in
  America, where it is exceedingly abundant and destructive, as the "Army
  Worm." It ranges through India, China, and Japan, and occurs in many
  other parts of the world, including Madeira and the Canary Isles. It is
  rare in Europe, and appears to have been noted in parts of Spain,
  Portugal, and France. Since Haworth described and <!-- Page 311 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="473.png"><a name="page311"></a>{311}</span>named
  it <i>unipuncta</i> in 1803 it has been renamed many times, and was long
  known in England as <i>extranea</i>, Guenée. About a score have been
  recorded as taken in the British Isles altogether, and of these two only
  in Ireland; the others were captured in England and Wales, and nearly all
  on the south or south-west coast, chiefly in the month of September. The
  most recent being one in the New Forest, Hampshire, 1896, one in Devon,
  1903, one in 1907, and one in 1911. Also in Isle of Wight, 1912.</p>

<h5><b>The Cosmopolitan</b> (<i>Leucania</i> (<i>Cirphis</i>) <i>loreyi</i>).</h5>

  <p>Barrett accepted this species as British, chiefly on the strength of
  two specimens captured at sugar by a sedgy ditch, nearer to Worthing than
  to Brighton in Sussex; the date was 1862. More recent records are one
  specimen at Torquay on September 27, 1900, and another, also in South
  Devon, September 6, 1903. The former taken at sugar, and the latter
  netted when "flying wildly over rough herbage at dusk." Ireland in
  1908.</p>

  <p>The species has a wide range through Southern and Eastern Asia, etc.,
  but in Europe it is only found in the south and along the Mediterranean.
  The specimen shown on Plate <a href="#plate149">149</a>, Fig. 6, is from
  India.</p>

<h5><b>The Delicate</b> (<i>Leucania</i> (<i>Sideridis</i>) <i>vitellina</i>).</h5>

  <p>The first recorded British specimen of this species (Plate <a
  href="#plate149">149</a>, Fig. 3) was captured at Brighton, Sussex, some
  fifty odd years ago. The species has occurred in and around that locality
  several times since, but seems to have been found more frequently at
  Torquay and other places on the Devonshire coast. It has also been
  recorded from the Scilly Isles, Cornwall, the Isle of Wight, the New
  Forest, and Chichester; Kent, on the coast, and inland at Canterbury,
  Sussex. In 1902, a year in which several specimens were obtained on the
  south coast, <!-- Page 312 --><span class="pagenum" title="474.png"><a
  name="page312"></a>{312}</span>one example was taken at Navestock, in
  Essex. August and September are the months during which it is seen in
  this country, but abroad it occurs also in June and July. The
  caterpillar, which feeds on grasses in the spring, is described by
  Hofmann as pinkish ochreous with three white lines on the back and black
  dots between them, two on each ring; below the black spiracles is a
  yellowish stripe; head brown with black dots.</p>

<h5><b>The White-point</b> (<i>Leucania</i> (<i>Sideridis</i>) <i>albipuncta</i>).</h5>

  <p>This species (Plate <a href="#plate149">149</a>, Fig. 5) appears to
  have been confused with the following one. It may be distinguished by its
  generally smaller size and the pure white spot on the fore wings. The
  colour of the fore wings is brownish red, rather than rusty tinged as in
  some reddish forms of <i>L. lithargyria</i>; the second cross line is
  more distinct, and the series of black marks beyond less so. The hind
  wings are paler than those of the next species. The caterpillar is
  yellowish wainscot brown above, inclining to flesh-colour on the sides
  and beneath; three white lines on the back, the central one edged on each
  side by a wavy blackish line, the outer ones edged above by a blackish
  line and below by a brownish line; a pale stripe low down along the
  sides; head ochreous, shining, and lined on the face with greyish. It
  feeds from autumn to spring on grasses. The moth is out from August to
  October. It occurs more or less frequently, and chiefly on the coast, in
  Kent (first taken at Folkestone, in 1868), Sussex, Hants, Isle of Wight,
  South Devon, and Essex (Shoeburyness).</p>

<h5><b>The Clay</b> (<i>Leucania</i> (<i>Sideridis</i>) <i>lithargyria</i>).</h5>

  <p>Two specimens of this species are shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate150">150</a>, Figs. 7 &#x2642;, 8 &#x2640;. The colour of the
  fore wings varies from pale ochreous brown, often with a pink tinge, to a
  deep rusty red; the reniform stigma is generally represented by a pale
  crescent with a white or whitish dot at its lower end; the cross lines
  are rarely distinct, but a series of black dots before the outer margin
  are usually well in evidence. The caterpillar is pale brown tinged with
  pinkish or yellowish; central line white edged with dark brown, and on
  each side of this is an interrupted broad blackish line edged below with
  white; a whitish line below the blackish spiracles; head and plate on the
  first ring of the body, pale brown, rather shining, the former freckled
  with blackish. It is found in April and May on grasses, probably after
  hibernation, The moth is out from late June to early August and is common
  in woods, and woody places throughout the greater part of the British
  Isles.</p>

<h5><b>The Brown-line Bright-eye</b> (<i>Leucania</i> (<i>Chabuata</i>)
<i>conigera</i>).</h5>

  <p>This species (Plate <a href="#plate150">150</a>, Figs. 1 &#x2642;, 2
  &#x2640;) ranges in the colour of fore wings from pale ochreous brown to
  a dusky tawny hue; the cross lines are sometimes very faint, but
  otherwise the markings are constant. Var. <i>suffusa</i>, Tutt, is
  described as rusty red suffused with darker scales, markings typical, but
  deeper in colour and more distinct. The caterpillar is ochreous or
  greyish brown; three yellow lines on the back are black edged; a yellow
  line along the sides is often edged with black, and the line below the
  black spiracles is blackish; head pale brown marked with black. It feeds
  on grasses, and may be found in April and May. The moth appears in June
  and July and is pretty generally distributed. It is regarded as a common
  species in South England, but in the north seems to be rather local and
  most frequently found on the coast. In Scotland it does not appear to
  have been noted north of Ross or in the isles. Abroad the range extends
  through Northern and Central Asia to India and Japan. <!-- Page 314
  --><span class="pagenum" title="478.png"><a
  name="page314"></a>{314}</span></p>

<h5><b>The Double Line</b> (<i>Leucania</i> (<i>Eriopyga</i>) <i>turca</i>).</h5>

  <p>The sexes of this species are shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate150">150</a>, Figs. 3 &#x2642;, 6 &#x2640;. The general
  colour of the fore wings may be paler or darker than in the specimens
  shown. Sometimes the central area enclosed by the black cross lines is
  darker than the other parts of the fore wings; var. <i>obscura</i>, Tutt,
  has the fore wings obscure smoky grey, with a dull coppery tinge, much
  suffused with dark scales; markings indistinct.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is pale brown freckled with darker; a whitish line
  along the middle of the back is edged on both sides with blackish merging
  into black at the ring divisions; a rather wavy, but less distinct,
  whitish line on each side of the central one edged above with blackish;
  spiracles black ringed with pale brown and set in a broad dark brown line
  below which the colour is pinkish; head shining pale brown, freckled with
  darker on the cheeks. It feeds on cocksfoot and various other grasses
  occurring in woodlands. August to May. The moth, which inhabits woods and
  well-timbered parks, is out in June and July. It is, perhaps, most
  frequent in the New Forest, Hampshire, thence it is found more or less
  sparingly to Cornwall. Sometimes not uncommon in Savernake Forest,
  Wiltshire, and occurs in Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Essex (Epping
  Forest, etc.), Surrey (Richmond Park). Recorded from Cheshire and from
  South Wales. In Scotland it is said to have been taken at Newfield,
  Ayrshire. The only records from Ireland are Clonbrock (1), and Merlin
  Park, Galway (2). Abroad it ranges to Amurland, China, Corea and
  Japan.</p>

<h5><b>Treble Lines</b> (<i>Meristis</i> (<i>Grammesia</i>) <i>trigrammica</i>).</h5>

  <p>The fore wings range in colour from whitish or greyish brown to
  ochreous brown; the cross lines are usually distinct, <!-- Page 315
  --><span class="pagenum" title="479.png"><a
  name="page315"></a>{315}</span>and the central one is often broad. (Plate
  <a href="#plate151">151</a>, Fig. 1.) In var. <i>approximans</i>, Haw.,
  the cross lines fall nearer together on the inner margin; and in var.
  <i>semi-fuscans</i>, Haw., the basal half is greyish or reddish grey, and
  the outer half is suffused with brownish (Fig. 2). Then there is a
  somewhat rarer form, with dark grey, brown, or blackish brown fore wings,
  with the cross lines more or less distinct, as in Fig. 3; or with the
  central one absent (var. <i>bilinea</i>, Hübn.); or all the lines may be
  obscured by the dark colour. Kane states that var. <i>obscura</i>, Tutt
  (= <i>bilinea</i>, Haw.), is pretty common at Howth and other places in
  Ireland, and, according to Barrett, it is not infrequent in Wales. The
  caterpillar is greyish or dingy reddish brown; three pale lines on the
  back, the central one partly edged with black, and the outer ones are
  broken and inwardly edged with blackish marks; the stripe along the black
  spiracles is ochreous brown; head brownish. From July to April on
  plantain and other low plants. The moth is out in June and July. In
  Scotland it is local and rare, but has been recorded from Clydesdale,
  Arran, and once from Perthshire. Local but widely distributed in
  Ireland.</p>

<h5><b>The Anomalous</b> (<i>Stilbia anomala</i>).</h5>

  <p>A local species, but sometimes not uncommon on heaths, or in rocky
  places by the sea. It is found from Surrey westward to Cornwall; and from
  Staffordshire, in which county it has been seen in abundance on Cannock
  Chase, it ranges into Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire, Cheshire, Wales (North
  and South), Lancashire, Yorkshire (commonly at Saltaire), Durham (once),
  and Cumberland. Generally distributed in Scotland, including the Orkneys.
  It occurs in the Isle of Man, and seems to be pretty widely spread in
  Ireland, but found chiefly on the coast. Abroad it seems to be only found
  in France and in Central and Western Germany. In Southern Spain it is
  <!-- Page 316 --><span class="pagenum" title="480.png"><a
  name="page316"></a>{316}</span>represented by var. <i>andalusiaca</i>,
  Staud., and in Syria by var. <i>syriaca</i>, Staud. A typical male is
  shown on Plate <a href="#plate151">151</a>, Fig. 4.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is green, inclining to yellowish between the rings of
  the body; three lines on the back are whitish, edged with dark green; a
  stripe low down on the sides is whitish, shaded above with dark green
  merging into the ground colour; head shining bright green, obscurely
  mottled with darker. In other forms the general colour is reddish or
  pinkish brown, with the lines edged and shaded with darker brown; the
  head is ochreous brown, mottled with darker brown. The green form is
  figured on Plate <a href="#plate152">152</a>, Fig. 6, but the browner
  forms are more frequent. It feeds on grasses from the autumn until about
  March.</p>

<h5><b>The Mottled Rustic</b> (<i>Caradrina morpheus</i>).</h5>

  <p>A specimen of this species is shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate151">151</a>, Fig. 5. There is some variation in the darker
  mottling and suffusion of the ochreous or pale brown fore wings. The dark
  brown or blackish stigmata are generally distinct. Hind wings whitish,
  tinged with smoky on the veins, and in the female on the outer marginal
  area. The caterpillar is brownish or greyish brown, inclining to ochreous
  on the back; central line whitish, with a broken edging of brown; on each
  side of the central line there is a series of blackish arrow heads;
  spiracles blackish; head dark brown, and very glossy. It feeds from
  August and through the autumn on various low plants, including
  goose-foot, knot-grass, dandelion, etc. The moth flies from June to
  August, and occasionally there is a second flight in October. The species
  is generally distributed and often common over the greater part of
  England, but is less frequent in the more northern counties, and in
  Wales, Ireland, and Scotland. Abroad the range extends to Amurland and
  Corea.</p>

<h5><b>The Uncertain</b> (<i>Caradrina alsines</i>).</h5>

  <p>This species (Plate <a href="#plate151">151</a>, Fig. 6) and the next
  one&mdash;The Rustic&mdash;are often confused, but the present one may be
  recognized by the more ochreous tinge of its fore wings, the more
  distinct markings, and the general rougher appearance of all the wings.
  The hind wings are more smoky, or sometimes brownish tinged.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is ochreous brown, frequently with a reddish tinge;
  three whitish lines on the back, edged with black, the edging of the
  central one interrupted at the ring divisions; a dusky area along the
  sides is edged above and below by a black line; head ochreous brown. It
  feeds from September to March on dock, chickweed, primrose, and various
  other low plants. The moth flies in July and August, and, like most of
  its congeners, is partial to the blossoms of privet. The species is
  widely distributed over England, but seems to occur more commonly in the
  south and east. It is also found in Wales, Scotland, and Ireland.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Note.</span>&mdash;<i>C. superstes</i>, an inhabitant
  of Central and Southern Germany, Hungary, Southern Europe, and Asia
  Minor, has been mentioned as British, but the record needs
  confirmation.</p>

<h5><b>The Rustic</b> (<i>Caradrina taraxaci</i>).</h5>

  <p>Compared with the last species, the one now considered (Plate <a
  href="#plate151">151</a>, Fig. 7) has browner fore wings, inclining to
  brownish or blackish, smoother and glossy; and the markings are usually
  rather obscure. The hind wings are silky, and whiter in the male.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is greyish brown, with an olive tinge; central line
  dark brown, expanding on each ring; on either side of this is a
  brown-edged white line; a light brown line along the spiracles; head
  ochreous brown. It feeds from September to April on low plants, such as
  dock, chickweed, plantain, etc. <!-- Page 318 --><span class="pagenum" title="484.png"
  ><a name="page318"></a>{318}</span>The moth flies from late June to early
  August, and its range in the British Isles is pretty much as in the last
  species, but more generally distributed than <i>alsines</i> in
  Ireland.</p>

<h5><b>Vine's Rustic</b> (<i>Caradrina ambigua</i>).</h5>

  <p>The fore wings of this species (Plate <a href="#plate151">151</a>,
  Fig. 8) are rather greyer than those of the last, and the hind wings are
  shining white, tinged with greyish brown in the female, especially on the
  veins.</p>

  <p>Barrett describes the caterpillar as follows: "Plump, cylindrical;
  head round, the lobes dark brown, but the face paler; dorsal region
  between the subdorsal lines broadly yellowish brown, with slender,
  delicate, oblique lines on each segment; dorsal line a row of black dots,
  one on each segment; lateral space from the subdorsal lines to the
  spiracles darker brown or umberous, containing a row of ovate, oblique,
  yellowish spots, each rather raised into a knob by the wrinkling of the
  skin; spiracles black; under surface, legs, and prolegs pale rosy brown,
  except the anal prolegs, which are brown." It feeds from October to May
  on dandelion, plantain, chickweed, and other low plants; also on lettuce
  and grass. The moth flies in August and September. Sometimes the
  caterpillars will feed up and attain the moth state the same year in
  November or December. The species was not known to occur in England until
  some specimens were taken by Mr. Vine at sugar, near Shoreham, Sussex, in
  1879. Since that year it has been taken more or less freely at several
  places on the south and south-west coast, from Deal, in Kent, to Truro,
  in Cornwall.</p>

<h5><b>The Pale Mottled Willow</b> (<i>Caradrina quadripunctata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The black spots on the front margin of the fore wings of this species
  (Plate <a href="#plate151">151</a>, Figs. 9, 10) are pretty constant
  characters, <!-- Page 319 --><span class="pagenum" title="485.png"><a
  name="page319"></a>{319}</span>and are usually present even when most or
  all the other markings are absent. The caterpillar is greyish brown,
  often tinged with green above; the lines are faintly paler, and edged
  with darker; head blackish. It feeds from September to May on grasses,
  seeds of plantain; also on peas and corn; often common in stacks of wheat
  and other grain.</p>

  <p>The moth flies chiefly in July and August, but it is sometimes seen as
  early as May and as late as October. Generally distributed, and often
  very common. Except that it does not occur in America the range abroad is
  almost as extensive as that of the next species.</p>

<h5><b>Small Mottled Willow</b> (<i>Laphygma</i> (<i>Caradrina</i>) <i>exigua</i>).</h5>

  <p>This species (Plate <a href="#plate151">151</a>, Fig. 11) practically
  ranges over the globe. It is the "Beet Army-worm" of American economic
  entomologists; whilst in South Africa it is known in the early stage as
  "The Pigweed Caterpillar." In Asia, and especially in India, where it is
  destructive to the indigo plants, maize, etc., it is a familiar pest, but
  does not seem to bear a common name. As regards our own country, it was
  apparently unnoticed until somewhere about the middle of the last
  century, when a specimen was captured in the Isle of Wight. Its
  occurrence here is always considered a noteworthy event, but the records
  are very scanty except for the years 1896, 1897, 1900-03, and 1906. In
  the latter year there seems to have been an invasion on quite a large
  scale, and captures in some localities on the south and south-west coasts
  must have been in hundreds, whilst the species was also taken in fewer
  numbers in Essex, Surrey, Wiltshire, Somerset, Devon, and South Wales. A
  specimen occurred at Crosby, Lancs., in 1884. In 1903 one example was
  taken at Chester, Cheshire. At Keighley, Yorks, eight were secured,
  which, added to three taken in other years, gives a total of eleven
  specimens for the county. In Ireland one example was <!-- Page 320
  --><span class="pagenum" title="486.png"><a
  name="page320"></a>{320}</span>obtained at honeydew, September, 1899, at
  Timologue, Co. Cork.</p>

  <p>The eggs (Plate <a href="#plate152">152</a>, Fig. 7<i>a</i>) are laid
  in batches on a leaf, and more or less covered with whitish hairs. Some
  deposited on Sept. 8, 1906, hatched on the 20th of that month. When just
  hatched the caterpillar is greenish, paler on the last rings; head and
  plate on first ring shining black; when a week old a black plate appears
  on the last ring also. Later on the colour varies from green to olive
  green, brownish, and dark greyish. Green examples are figured on Plate <a
  href="#plate152">152</a>, Fig. 7. The central line is ochreous, and there
  are series of black bars and blackish marks on the back; along the
  black-edged white spiracles is a pinkish brown band, edged above by an
  interrupted black line; the pinkish brown colour runs up the front part
  of each ring four to eleven; head blackish. The caterpillars were fed
  upon plantain, dandelion, and groundsel, but they would eat the foliage
  of any weed that was put in their cage. They formed fairly tough earthen
  cocoons on, or just below, the surface; but, although they pupated, the
  moths failed to emerge, probably because they were kept too dry. The
  ochreous or pinkish brown colour of the orbicular stigma, and sometimes
  of the reniform, distinguishes this moth; the hind wings are white with a
  very distinct pearly gloss.</p>

<h5><b>The Small Dotted Buff</b> (<i>Petilampa arcuosa</i>).</h5>

  <p>This pale whity-brown insect (Plate <a href="#plate134">134</a>, Figs.
  19 to 21) is often without markings, and where these are present on the
  fore wings they comprise two series of dusky dots representing two cross
  lines, and sometimes there is a dot at the end of the cell. These wings
  may be shaded with brown, and occasionally there is a dark band-like
  shade between the series of dots, in the male as well as in the smaller
  and narrower-winged female. Var. <i>morrisii</i>, Dale, seems to be a
  whiter form of this species. <!-- Page 321 --><span class="pagenum" title="487.png"
  ><a name="page321"></a>{321}</span>The caterpillar, which may be found in
  May and June in the flower stems of <i>Aira cæspitosa</i>, is of a pale
  pinkish ochreous with three darker bars on each ring, and a brown, glossy
  head. The moth flies in July and part of August, and may be found, often
  in abundance, in most English and Welsh counties, in Scotland to
  Aberdeenshire; and widely spread in Ireland.</p>

<h5><b>The Reddish Buff</b> (<i>Acosmetia caliginosa</i>).</h5>

  <p>Both sexes of this reddish tinged grey-brown species are shown on
  Plate <a href="#plate153">153</a>, Figs. 1 &#x2642;, 3 &#x2640;. As will
  be noted, the female is much smaller than the male. Except that it has
  been recorded from the Isle of Wight and from Bloxworth, Dorset, in the
  past, this species is restricted to certain portions of the New Forest,
  Hampshire. Even in these favoured haunts its numbers have become far less
  than formerly. The moth is out in July. Apparently it has no taste for
  sugar, neither does it seem to visit blossoms of any kind. It may be
  disturbed from its retreat among the grass by day, or netted as it flies
  at dusk. The caterpillar is stated by Hofmann to live on saw-wort
  (<i>Serratula tinctoria</i>); it is sap-green, yellow at the ring
  divisions, and marked with fine white lines.</p>

<h5><b>The Marsh Moth</b> (<i>Hydrilla palustris</i>).</h5>

  <p>The fore wings of the male of this species (Plate <a
  href="#plate153">153</a>, Fig. 2) are greyish brown in colour, and more
  or less tinged with violet; the cross lines are dusky, and the reniform
  and orbicular stigmata are represented by black dots, the former the
  larger; hind wings whitish with a smoky tinge. The female is much
  smaller, darker, and the cross lines heavier; hind wings blackish
  grey.</p>

  <p>Stainton ("Manual," 1857) refers to a specimen taken at Compton's
  Wood, near York, and this, no doubt, is the same as <!-- Page 322
  --><span class="pagenum" title="488.png"><a
  name="page322"></a>{322}</span>that stated by Barrett to have been
  captured in a moist place at Stockton-in-the-Forest, about four miles
  from York, certainly before the year 1855. Then there is a record of a
  specimen from Quy Fen, Cambridgeshire, in May, 1862. Seven years later
  the late Mr. C. G. Barrett took a specimen as it fluttered about a
  gas-lamp outside Norwich. In 1877 and 1878 the use of bright collecting
  lanterns in Wicken Fen may have led to the capture of nearly twenty Marsh
  Moths, anyway it seems to have been a record for the time.</p>

  <p>Very few specimens were taken in the fens between the year last
  mentioned and 1898, when the total secured by several collectors visiting
  the fens in June of that year amounted to something like fifty examples,
  all males. Two female specimens were captured in the Carlisle district,
  one in 1896, and the other in 1897. No male was noted in that locality
  until 1899, when a specimen was netted as it flew along a hedgeside at
  night, on May 20. Two other males have since been taken there, in much
  the same way. The life history of the species is little known. Hofmann
  describes the caterpillar as reddish brown with white dots, and a white
  line along the middle of the back; spiracles and head black. It feeds in
  the summer on low-growing plants in meadows, and hides in the daytime on
  the underside of a leaf.</p>

  <p>The range of the species abroad extends to Siberia and Amurland.</p>

<h5><b>The Brown Rustic</b> (<i>Rusina tenebrosa</i>).</h5>

  <p>Here, again, the female is smaller than the male, as will be seen on
  Plate <a href="#plate153">153</a>, Figs. 4 &#x2642;, 5 &#x2640;.
  Sometimes the general colour of the fore wings is of a blacker tint, and
  in such specimens the fine black cross lines are obscured.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is dark cinnamon brown; three whitish lines on the
  back, the central one, most distinct on the front rings, is edged on each
  side with dark brown, and the shading of the outer lines is interrupted
  by oblique pale dashes; head, shining dark brown, almost blackish. It
  feeds on grasses, and many low-growing plants from August to May. (Plate
  <a href="#plate152">152</a>, Fig. 4.) The moth flies in June and July,
  sometimes earlier. The species is generally distributed over nearly the
  whole of England, but more local in the north than in the south. It is
  found in North and South Wales. In Scotland it is locally abundant and
  widely distributed up to Ross, and occurs in the Hebrides. It is also
  widely spread in Ireland, and common in some parts.</p>

  <p><i>Umbratica</i>, Goeze, is said to be an earlier name for this
  species, and will probably have to be adopted.</p>

<h5><b>The Copper Underwing</b> (<i>Amphipyra pyramidea</i>).</h5>

  <p>The striking species shown on Plate <a href="#plate154">154</a>, Figs.
  1 to 3, varies somewhat in the tint of its brown-coloured fore wings, and
  in the greater or lesser amount of blackish shading on the central area;
  the latter is sometimes quite absent, and not infrequently the outer
  marginal area is pale ochreous brown. The hind wings, normally of a
  coppery colour, are occasionally paler, and sometimes of a reddish
  hue.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is green with three interrupted whitish stripes on the
  back; the dots are yellowish; and the stripe along the black-edged white
  spiracles is whitish; the back of ring eleven is raised, forming a cone,
  the apex of which is hornlike and slightly curved backwards; the head is
  green. It feeds from April, or in forward seasons from March, to June, on
  the foliage of oak, birch, sallow, plum, rose, and other trees and
  shrubs. The moth flies from late July to September, and sometimes later.
  Although somewhat local in Southern England, it is often common enough in
  the New Forest, and most of the larger woods from Essex to Devonshire.
  Northwards from Oxfordshire it becomes more local, less frequent, and
  even rare, <!-- Page 324 --><span class="pagenum" title="492.png"><a
  name="page324"></a>{324}</span>except, perhaps, in Worcestershire
  (Malvern district, common) and Herefordshire. Apparently not recorded
  from Scotland. In Ireland it is sometimes plentiful in the south, but
  does not seem to occur north of Sligo on the west, and Howth on the
  east.</p>

<h5><b>The Mouse</b> (<i>Amphipyra tragopogonis</i>).</h5>

  <p>The English name of this generally distributed, and usually common,
  greyish-brown moth (Plate <a href="#plate154">154</a>, Figs. 4, 5)
  applies more especially to the mouse-like way it scuttles off when
  discovered in its retreat by the collector. In colour, however, it is
  sometimes not unlike the familiar little rodent. The caterpillar (Plate
  <a href="#plate156">156</a>, Fig. 3) is green with white lines and
  stripes along the back and sides; spiracles white, margined with black;
  head yellowish-green. In another form the ground colour is pale reddish
  brown. It feeds from April to June on sallow, hawthorn, and many other
  plants. Barrett states that it is partial to the blossoms, particularly
  yellow ones, of garden as well as wild plants. The moth flies in July and
  August, sometimes later.</p>

  <p>The range abroad extends to Central Asia and to the Atlantic States of
  America.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Note.</span>&mdash;Some recent authors refer this and
  the preceding species to <i>Pyrophila</i>, Hübn.</p>

<h5><b>The Pine Beauty</b> (<i>Panolis griseo-variegata</i> = <i>piniperda</i>).</h5>

  <p>The general colour of the fore wings of this species (Plate <a
  href="#plate155">155</a>, Figs. 1, 3 &#x2642;, 2 &#x2640;) is ochreous
  brown, more or less reddish tinged; sometimes greenish grey. The cross
  markings are bright or dull reddish brown; the orbicular and reniform
  stigmata are white, or outlined in white, sometimes connected by a white
  line along the median nervure; occasionally these marks are united,
  forming a blotch. <!-- Page 325 --><span class="pagenum" title="493.png"
  ><a name="page325"></a>{325}</span></p>

  <p>The caterpillar is green with three broad white lines along the back,
  the outer ones edged above with black; a yellow, inclining to reddish
  orange, stripe along the black spiracles; head reddish brown. It greatly
  resembles the needles of the Scotch fir (<i>Pinus sylvestris</i>), upon
  which it feeds from May to July. The moth is out in the spring and
  continues on the wing until early May, and is often common at sallow
  bloom, where this occurs in the immediate vicinity of pine woods; it also
  comes to the sugar patch not infrequently, and may occasionally be seen
  on the trunks of fir trees, or beaten from the boughs. The species seems
  to occur wherever there are fir woods or plantations throughout England,
  Wales, and Scotland to Ross, and is found locally in Ireland.</p>

<h5><b>The White-Marked</b> (<i>Pachnobia leucographa</i>).</h5>

  <p>A portrait of this moth will be found on Plate <a
  href="#plate155">155</a>, Fig. 4. The fore wings are reddish brown,
  sometimes tinged with purplish, or clouded with blackish. The reniform
  and orbicular stigmata are usually yellowish grey, often only outlined,
  but not infrequently indistinct, and sometimes absent. The cross lines
  are rarely well defined, although the second line may be indicated by
  blackish dots flanked by whitish ones on the veins.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is green freckled with whitish; three whitish lines
  along the back are edged with dark green, the outer ones with oblique
  dark-green dashes spreading to the central line; head paler green. In
  another form the general colour is pale reddish brown, lines yellowish,
  and dashes darker reddish brown. It feeds on sallow, bilberry, dock,
  plantain, and other low plants. May and June. The moth flies in March and
  April, and may be found at sallow bloom around woods. The species is
  obtained more or less frequently in Kent, Surrey, Sussex, Hampshire,
  Somerset, and Devon; also in Buckinghamshire and in Suffolk. In
  Herefordshire it is local but not <!-- Page 326 --><span class="pagenum" title="494.png"
  ><a name="page326"></a>{326}</span>uncommon, and I have taken it in the
  Malvern district. British specimens were first obtained near York.
  Porritt ("List of Yorks. Lep.," 1904) states that it is still abundant in
  Bishop's Wood, and is found in other Yorkshire localities; also occurs
  from Lancashire to Durham. In Ireland it has been reported from
  Clonbrock, Galway.</p>

<h5><b>The Red Chestnut</b> (<i>Pachnobia rubricosa</i>).</h5>

  <p>The fore wings of this moth (Plate <a href="#plate155">155</a>, Figs.
  5, 6) are purplish red and more or less suffused with greyish. Sometimes
  these wings are more distinctly reddish and without the greyish suffusion
  (var. <i>rufa</i>, Haw.). The egg is pale straw colour, with a
  reddish-brown girdled dot. The caterpillar (Plate <a
  href="#plate159">159</a>, Fig. 3) is pinkish brown with three yellowish
  lines along the back, the central one rather obscure; a yellowish stripe
  along the sides; usual dots yellowish or whitish margined with blackish;
  head yellowish brown, lined with darker brown. It feeds from April to
  June on dock, dandelion, groundsel, and other low plants. The moth is out
  in March and April, and is often not uncommon at sallow and plum blossom.
  It seems to be pretty generally distributed throughout the British Isles,
  including the Orkneys.</p>

<h5><b>The Hebrew Character</b> (<i>Tæniocampa gothica</i>).</h5>

  <p>This species (Plate <a href="#plate155">155</a>) varies in the general
  colour of the fore wings from pale purplish grey to dark reddish brown.
  Figs. 7&#x2642; and 8&#x2640; represent the more usual form. The black
  markings, often very conspicuous, are in the somewhat smaller var.
  <i>gothicina</i>, reddish (Fig. 9). Sometimes in Scotch specimens they
  are very indistinct or absent (Fig. 10).</p>

  <p>The early stages are figured on Plate <a href="#plate156">156</a>. The
  eggs (Fig. 1<i>a</i>) are laid in a batch, two deep towards the centre of
  the <!-- Page 327 --><span class="pagenum" title="495.png"><a
  name="page327"></a>{327}</span>heap. In colour they are whitish with a
  dark grey ring and dot. When five days old the young caterpillars were
  pale whitish green with black dots; head and plates on first and last
  rings of the body black. The nearly full-grown caterpillar (Fig. 1) is
  green above and yellowish green below; three whitish lines on the back
  and a yellowish stripe along the sides; usual dots black, ringed with
  whitish; head shining yellowish, dotted with black. Feeding on dock,
  dandelion, etc., it will also eat sallow and hawthorn, and the foliage of
  other trees and bushes, in April, May, and June. The moth is common at
  sallow bloom all over the British Isles. The range of the species abroad
  extends to Amurland.</p>

<h5><b>The Blossom Underwing</b> (<i>Tæniocampa miniosa</i>).</h5>

  <p>A portrait of this species will be found on Plate <a
  href="#plate158">158</a>, Fig. 8. The fore wings are pinkish, or reddish
  grey, and the redder central area is often tinged with orange; the hind
  wings are whitish, faintly shaded or tinged with pink.</p>

  <p>The full-grown caterpillar is bluish, inclining to black on the sides;
  three yellow lines on the back, the central one broad; and a white
  blotched yellow stripe along the sides; head shining black. (Adapted from
  Fenn.) The eggs are laid in batches on the twigs of oak, usually just
  below a bud. When the caterpillars hatch out they spin a web of silk
  under which they live in company for a time; later on they separate, and
  then either continue to feed on the oak or betake themselves to birch,
  hawthorn, bramble, or some low-growing herbaceous plant. The "nests" of
  young caterpillars are found chiefly on oak bushes rather than trees.</p>

  <p>The moth flies in March and April, and generally occurs only in oak
  woods. It is most frequently met with in the South of England&mdash;from
  Middlesex and Essex to Hampshire; but it occurs in most of the southern
  counties, and also northwards <!-- Page 328 --><span class="pagenum" title="496.png"
  ><a name="page328"></a>{328}</span>up to Yorkshire. It has been found in
  Wales (Pembroke and Dolgelly), and appears to be rare in Ireland, except
  at Glenmalure, Co. Wicklow.</p>

<h5><b>The Small Quaker</b> (<i>Tæniocampa pulverulenta</i>).</h5>

  <p>Most specimens of this species (Plate <a href="#plate158">158</a>,
  Figs. 9&#x2642;, 10&#x2640;) have the fore wings pale greyish ochreous,
  more or less mottled or dusted with reddish brown. Occasionally these
  wings are pale grey (var. <i>nana</i>, Haworth); or dark grey brown and
  more rarely blackish. The dingy brownish dots representing the first and
  second cross lines are sometimes distinct and not infrequently
  absent.</p>

  <p>The egg is whitish with brown girdled dot.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is greenish grey and rather greener between the rings;
  there are five yellow or whitish lines, that along the centre of the back
  being the broadest, usual dots black and glossy; head greenish, much
  marked with black: plates on first and last rings of the body black. It
  feeds from April to June on oak, hawthorn, sallow, rose, etc. (Plate <a
  href="#plate159">159</a>, Fig. 2.) The moth flies in March and April, and
  is a constant visitor to the sallow catkins, also to the blossoms of
  plum, damson, and sloe. It appears to be common throughout England and
  Wales; more or less frequent in Scotland to Moray; and is not uncommon in
  some districts of Wicklow and Galway, but local and rather scarce in
  other parts of Ireland.</p>

<h5><b>The Common Quaker</b> (<i>Tæniocampa stabilis</i>).</h5>

  <p>The ground colour of the fore wings of this species (Plate <a
  href="#plate158">158</a>, Figs. 1, 2) ranges from whitish or pale grey
  brown through tints of reddish brown to dark brown; the stigmata are
  outlined in pale ochreous, the centres often darker than the general
  colour of the wings; the orbicular is of large size and frequently <!--
  Page 329 --><span class="pagenum" title="497.png"><a
  name="page329"></a>{329}</span>touches the reniform; the ochreous
  submarginal line is usually inwardly edged with, and sometimes obscured
  by, blackish; very often the submarginal line and the dusky central shade
  are the only distinct cross markings.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is green, minutely dotted with yellow; three lines on
  the back, and a stripe on the sides, yellow, the latter most distinct,
  edged above with black, and united by a yellow bar on the last ring. It
  feeds on oak, birch, sallow, beech, elm, etc., from April to June. The
  moth flies in March and April, and is generally common throughout the
  British Isles, except, perhaps, the islands of Scotland.</p>

<h5><b>The Lead-coloured Drab</b> (<i>Tæniocampa populeti</i>).</h5>

  <p>The ground colour of the species shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate157">157</a>, Figs. 7, 8, is usually some shade of purplish
  grey, ranging from very pale to dark; the cross lines are often
  indistinct, but occasionally they show up clearly; the central shade,
  usually in evidence, is sometimes almost blackish and broadened out to
  the second line; the orbicular and reniform have pale margins but the
  centres are frequently no darker than the general colour.</p>

  <p>The egg is greyish white with dark grey girdled dot.</p>

  <p>When full grown the caterpillar is whitish or yellowish green, but
  always whitish on the back: three white lines on the back, the central
  one rather broad; head ochreous brown with a blackish spot on each side.
  It feeds from April to June on aspen chiefly, but also on other kinds of
  poplar, hiding by day between two leaves. The moth is out in March and
  April, and may be found on the sallow catkins. It seems to be more or
  less rare in the South of England, but it is locally not uncommon in many
  parts of the country from Middlesex northwards to Yorkshire. Farther
  north it is again infrequent, and this is also the case in Scotland and
  in Ireland. <!-- Page 330 --><span class="pagenum" title="498.png"><a
  name="page330"></a>{330}</span></p>

<h5><b>The Clouded Drab</b> (<i>Tæniocampa incerta</i>).</h5>

  <p>Six specimens of this most variable species are shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate157">157</a>, Figs. 1 to 6. To refer in detail to all the
  forms, named or otherwise, would occupy much space, so that it can only
  be stated here that the general colour of the fore wings ranges from pale
  greyish brown, through various shades of reddish brown, to deep brown or
  purplish brown; the darker greys range through slaty grey to purplish
  black. In all the lighter shades the wings are usually much variegated,
  but they may be nearly or quite plain.</p>

  <p>The egg is yellowish white with brown girdled dot.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is green, minutely freckled with whitish; three white
  lines on the back, the central one broadest; a white stripe, edged above
  with black, along the sides; usual dots black, minute, ringed with
  whitish; head yellowish green with a few black dots. It feeds on sallow,
  oak, hawthorn, also on apple, elm, etc. (Plate <a
  href="#plate156">156</a>, Fig. 2.) The moth is generally to be found at
  sallow-bloom in almost every part of the British Isles.</p>

<h5><b>The Twin-spotted Quaker</b> (<i>Tæniocampa munda</i>).</h5>

  <p>The fore wings range in ground colour from very pale ochreous
  (typical) or pale greyish (var. <i>pallida</i>, Tutt), through reddish
  shades to a dingy brown. The black or brownish twin spots on the middle
  of the submarginal line are sometimes accompanied by others above and
  below them (var. <i>geminatus</i>). In var. <i>immaculata</i>, Staud.,
  the "twin spots," and also the others, are absent. (Plate <a
  href="#plate158">158</a>, Figs. 11, 12.)</p>

  <p>The caterpillar (Plate <a href="#plate159">159</a>, Fig. 1) is pale
  brown minutely freckled with darker; a whitish line along the centre of
  the back finely edged with black; a broad velvety black stripe along the
  sides, edged with whitish; head reddish brown, freckled with darker. It
  feeds from April to June on elm, oak, sallow, plum, etc. The moth is out
  in March and April, but a specimen has been taken at "ivy bloom" in the
  autumn. Plum blossoms, as well as the sallow catkins, are an attraction
  to this moth, and it will also visit the sugar patch. The species
  probably occurs in most woodland districts throughout the greater part of
  England and Wales. It seems to be found in South Scotland, but is local
  and infrequent; in Ireland it is widely spread in the north, but uncommon
  in the south.</p>

<h5><b>The Northern Drab</b> (<i>Tæniocampa opima</i>).</h5>

  <p>The dark form (var. <i>brunnea</i>, Tutt) (Plate <a
  href="#plate157">157</a>, Fig. 10 &#x2642;) has the outlines of the
  orbicular and reniform stigmata, and the submarginal line pale and
  distinct; sometimes the general colour is much blacker than in the
  specimen shown. In the more typical greyish form (Fig. 9 &#x2640;) the
  central area is blackish or dark reddish brown. The caterpillar is olive
  green above, inclining to yellowish beneath; three pale lines on the
  back, and a yellow stripe along the black-edged white spiracles; head
  olive green. It feeds from April to June on sallow, willow, birch, rose,
  etc. The moth flies in March and April.</p>

  <p>As suggested by the English name, this moth was supposed to be
  confined to the northern counties from Cheshire to Cumberland and
  Northumberland, but it occurs more locally in Herefordshire,
  Worcestershire (Wyre Forest), Somerset, Gloucester, and Wales; also in
  Essex, Surrey, and Sussex. Renton records it from Roxburghshire in
  Scotland, and Kane states that it is local in Ireland.</p>

<h5><b>The Powdered Quaker</b> (<i>Tæniocampa gracilis</i>).</h5>

  <p>In the ordinary English form of this species (Plate <a
  href="#plate158">158</a>, Figs. 3 &#x2642;, 4 &#x2640;) the fore wings
  are pale whity brown, more or <!-- Page 332 --><span class="pagenum" title="502.png"
  ><a name="page332"></a>{332}</span>less tinged with grey; the submarginal
  line, and the stigmata, are usually distinct, but the other cross lines
  are only indicated by blackish dots on the veins. In Ireland the
  specimens are creamy white and very often tinged with pink (Fig. 5), but
  in the New Forest, Hants (Fig. 7), and in the marshes of North Kent (Fig.
  6), deep purplish grey, purplish brown, and reddish (var.
  <i>rufescens</i>, Cockerel) forms occur.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is green, sometimes tinged with yellowish or with
  bluish; usual spots whitish; three whitish or yellowish lines along the
  back and one along the sides, the latter shaded above with dark green or
  blackish; head ochreous brown. It feeds from May to July on meadow-sweet
  (<i>Spiræa</i>), fleabane (<i>Inula</i>), purple loosestrife (<i>Lythrum
  salicaria</i>), yellow loosestrife (<i>Lysimachia vulgaris</i>),
  sweet-gale, sallow, bramble, etc. The moth is out in April and May, and
  is often plentiful at damson and plum blossom, as well as sallow catkins.
  The species is widely distributed throughout the greater part of the
  British Isles, but is perhaps more generally common in the southern and
  eastern counties of England. The range abroad extends to Japan.</p>

<h5 class="lg125">APPENDIX.</h5>

  <p>Page 28. <b>Herse Convolvuli.</b>&mdash;Reported from several English
  counties, August and September, 1911, and again in 1915. In 1917 the
  species seems to have been more widely spread over our islands, specimens
  being recorded from Ireland and Shetland.</p>

  <p>Page 41. <b>Phryxus Livornica.</b>&mdash;Further records are: In July,
  1909, a dead male specimen was found under an electric light standard at
  Exeter, and one was noted on a bowling green at Blackpool in October.
  Specimens were recorded from Surrey, Sussex, Hants, Devon, and Cornwall
  in 1911. On January 19, 1912, a male was taken from a shrub in a garden
  at Tavistock. Thirty-five were captured in South Cornwall between May 9
  and 23 of the same year, and single specimens were reported from North
  Wales, Norfolk, Dorset, also in May.</p>

  <p>Page 47. <b>Daphnis Nerii.</b>&mdash;Further records: Ilfracombe,
  September 22, 1909; Sydenham, September 24, 1910; Eastbourne (August 15),
  Ashford, 1911; Folkestone, August 30, 1916, on trunk of poplar tree;
  Littleover, Derbyshire, in a conservatory, August 18, 1917; Dovercourt,
  Essex, September, 1919. <!-- Page 334 --><span class="pagenum" title="504.png"

  <p>Page 141. <b>Nola Confusalis.</b>&mdash;A grey form of this species,
  ab. <i>columbina</i>, Image, has been recorded from Epping Forest.</p>

  <p>Page 146. <b>Sarrothripa Revayana.</b>&mdash;A number of forms of this
  species are named and described by Mr. Sheldon in the <i>Entomologist</i>
  for 1919.</p>

  <p>Page 268. <b>Luperina gueneei.</b>&mdash;Over thirty years ago the
  late Mr. Baxter, of St. Anne's, Lancashire, sent me a specimen of
  <i>Luperina</i> that he had captured in his district. This I considered
  to be a form connecting <i>gueneei</i> with <i>nickerlii</i>, and that
  both were forms of <i>L. testacea</i>. Since that time <i>gueneei</i> has
  been found in some numbers on the Lancs. coast, and has been recognized
  as a distinct species, and its identity with <i>nickerlii</i>
  established.</p>

  <p>The earlier published history of this species in Britain may here be
  quoted: "The late Mr. J. B. Hodgkinson, in a note on <i>Luperina
  gueneei</i>, published in the <i>Entomologist</i> for 1885, vol. 54,
  wrote:&mdash;'In 1860 or 1861, T. Porter (still living) brought me two
  fine specimens of a moth I did not know. They were of both sexes. I
  purchased them from him, and sent them on to the Rev. H. Burney, who
  forwarded them to Henry Doubleday. From him they went to Guenée, and he
  returned them with the remark that he had a specimen in his collection
  marked as a variety of <i>L. testacea</i>, but he was quite satisfied
  they represented a good species when he saw both sexes. H. Doubleday then
  named them after Guenée, as the latter was evidently the original captor.
  I saw Porter again, and he told me another man, by name H. Stephenson,
  had one. They took three in all near the ferry at Rhyl, North Wales. I
  sent Porter again, and went myself, but we failed to find more
  afterwards. I bought the specimen from Stephenson, and sent it to Miss
  Sulivan, of Fulham, where, I suppose, it remains. I think it was a
  female.'" <!-- Page 335 --><span class="pagenum" title="505.png"><a
  name="page335"></a>{335}</span></p>

  <p>According to Barrett (<i>British Lepidoptera</i>, IV., p. 335), the
  three North Wales specimens "were raked from overhanging edges of
  sandhills."</p>

  <p>The above is extracted from an instructive paper by the Rev. C. R. N.
  Burrows, entitled, "On the <i>nictitans</i> group of the genus
  <i>Hydr&oelig;cia</i>, Gn.," published in the <i>Transactions of the
  Entomological Society</i>, 1911, pp. 738-749, plates li.-lviii. In this
  paper specific rank is also claimed for <i>lucens</i>, Frr., and
  <i>paludis</i>, Tutt, both of which have been considered as merely forms
  of <i>H. nictitans</i>, L.</p>

  <p><i>H. crinanensis</i> has been recorded from Inveran, Crinan Canal,
  Aberfeldy, and Liddelbank, in Scotland; from Lough Foyle and Enniskillen,
  in Ireland; and from Bolton and Burnley, in England.</p>

  <p>Page 298. <b>Nonagria neurica.</b>&mdash;In 1907, when the first
  edition of this volume was published, the fact of <i>N. neurica</i> being
  a British species was not truly ascertained. In the following year,
  however, some specimens of <i>Nonagria</i>, which were not identical with
  <i>N. dissoluta</i>, Treit. = <i>arundineata</i>, Schmidt, were named
  <i>edelsteni</i>, Tutt. <!-- Page 336 --><span class="pagenum" title="506.png"
  ><a name="page336"></a>{336}</span></p>

  <p>Quite a number of <i>N. edelsteni</i> were obtained by Messrs.
  Wightman and Sharp in the Cuckmere Valley of Sussex, July, 1908.</p>

  <p>At a meeting of the Entomological Society of London, held on November
  4, 1908, a series of bred <i>edelsteni</i> from Sussex was exhibited by
  Mr. Edelsten.</p>

  <p>By a consensus of opinion among entomologists, Sussex specimens are
  now considered to be true British representatives of <i>neurica</i>,
  Hubn., Fig. 381.</p>

  <p>Page 332. <b>Peucephila Essoni</b>, Hamps.&mdash;On July 12, 1909, Mr.
  Esson, of Aberdeen, captured a specimen of a noctuid moth at sugar on a
  fir tree. This he sent to me for identification. As the insect was a
  novelty to me, it was submitted to Sir George F. Hampson, who, finding
  that the moth was not only a species new to science, but not even
  congeneric with any other noctuid, described and figured it as indicated
  on page 332 of this volume.</p>

  <p>Although keenly searched for, no other example of the species had been
  detected up to the end of 1919.</p>
